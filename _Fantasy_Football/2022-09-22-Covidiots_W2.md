# Deserving winners

The average margin of victory this week was ~28 points. For the most part losers deserved to lose, and then there's Steve but we'll get to that later. Shoutout to Seattle Krakens for having the only 2-0 start, as 8 teams sit at 1-1. 

## Waiver wire

It was a busy week on the waiver wire for Broncos Country Lets Ride (BCLR), though they missed out on all four of their bids. Surprisingly, only BCLR and Jesus Christ Superstars bid on Jimmy G with Wide Tiddys Tied Biddys preferring the budget pick of Joe "100 pass attempts in 2 games" Flacco.

## Go Birds

Jesus Christ Superstars (160.96pts) bested Alan's "still" One-Win Weiners (129.6pts). The stack of Lamar Jackson (42.62pts) and Mark Andrews (25.7pts) lead the way for the Superstars. The biggest difference was Tampa Bay's defense who Zach started against their own QB2 Jameis with a late TD for 25 total points. In comparison, the Weiners got a goose thanks to giving up 14 points with less than 2 minutes to play. I guess I should have forseen the Brownies being the Brownies. 

## Amon Rawesome

Team Tallman Kiss My A$$ (150.16pts) took down BCLR (93.86pts) led by stud WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (39.4pts). He survived relatively poor outings from Derrick Henry (8.5pts) and Travis Kelce (10.1pts). Good thing Team Tallman won or they would be kicking themselves for leaving Tua Tagovailoa (38.86pts) on the bench. BCLR didn't get any big performances with no one on their entire roster cracking 20pts.

## Woman of the House

Token Female (125.36pts) put Captain Kirk to Bridge (97.44pts) in their place. This was the lowest combined scoring matchup of the week. I'm surprised Token Female got to 125, with only 3 players outscoring projections. The Buffalo defense has scored 40 points in the last two weeks which is good enough for the QB11, WR10, RB5 (!), or the TE1. Captain Kirk to Bridge also lacked any 20+ point performances from their starters.

## Free Win No More

Who needs quarterbacks when your WRs combine for 99.1pts. Running Kupp That Hill (157.08pts) edged out Wide Tiddys Tied Biddys (141.34). RKTH benefited from Cooper Kupp's normal performance (33pts) and the Dolphin's huge comeback win from Tyreek Hill (42pts). Tyreek left the game with cramps, but later re-entered for 142 receiving yards in the 4th quarter alone after sipping some pickle juice. With huge performances from Aaron Jones (33pts) and Stefon Diggs (44.8pts) for WTTB, this matchup really came down to the tragic ankle injury for Trey Lance who finished with only 2.5pts.

## Closest of the week

Seattle Krakens (127.34pts) survived Red Solo Kupp (119.58pts) to be the only 2-0 team. Red Solo Kupp had some rough games from Hunter Henry (goose), Davante Adams (9.2pts) and JuJu (4pts). I'm surprised Red Solo Kupp didn't start Garrett Wilson (30pts) over Adams. The Krakens benefited from a bold start of Jahan Dotson (17.9pts) and the other arm of the Dolphins comeback Jaylen Waddle (40.1pts).

## Predictions

Last week I went 1-4 in predictions for a total of 3-7. ESPN projections also went 1-4 though so I'm not alone at least.
This week winners will be: "Alan's One-Win Weiners", "JCS", "BCLR", "Team Tallman Kiss My A$$", and "WTTB"
