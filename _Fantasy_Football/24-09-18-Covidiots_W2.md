Week 2 is brought to you by my 11 hour flight home. I'm through 2 movies so far (There Will be Blood / The Imitation Game) and have started "The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare". My review of the 3rd movie so far? Way too over the top but I'm beginning to realize that's the point.

Jump to matchups ["here"](#matchups). Back to the food! On Friday, Jess and I caught breakfast and espresso at Fira on the island of Santorini before sailing to the dormant Central volcano that spawned it's caldera. A pair of street gyros hit the spot after sailing before we returned to Oia for sunset. We dined at Meze Meze in the village of Finikia. I hesitantly ordered goat since I usually don't enjoy beef roast. The potatoes and carrots cooked in the meats fat however were divine.

Saturday was anniversary night in Parikia on the island of Paros at Bountoraki. Jess and I split some fried Feta, a bottle of Chardonnay produced on the East side of the island, and a pair of Seabream, both of which I needed to decapitate before Jess would start eating. We ate a little too late to order baklava for dessert (they had run out), but picked up some gelato on the wall home along the bay.

Sunday we ventured up to Naoussa and had a pair of sunset cocktails after a relaxing day on the beach. We were handed a free round there for apparently not being assholes, and made our way to an Italian restaurant for dinner. I ordered mussels on linguine and Jess and I again shared a bottle of local wine (it's like $20 a bottle and I'm on vacation don't judge). We caught a bus back to Parikia barely after I took a wrong turn and Jess suggested hopping a fence. There were only a few nights left and I hadn't yet tried Ouzo so Jess and I found ourselves in yet another bar and me with a 200mL bottle of Ouzo (~4.3 shots). The bottle listed 6 herbs as a distillate, the strongest of which was anise. Despite containing 40% ABV, the darned thing tasted like a pitzel and I was shortly on my ass.

Monday we sadly traveled back to Athens for one last day and dined at Soumbrak. The trip had to be wrapped up with a fresh block of Feta and "Fisherman's pasta" containing calamari, shrimp, mussels and octopus. Tuesday morning I sipped some hotel espresso while taking one final look at the Parthenon before hopping on a plane. I may miss the tastes of Greece, but I'm ready to see my dog and my own bed again. I think the literal gallon of olive oil we're returning with should help me get through.

# Matchups

Bill (163.8) completed their Monday Night Miracle TM against Alan's One Win Weiners (161.06). I ended up sitting Achane Thursday since he was going to be a game time decision, and game time happened to be 3am local for me. Honestly I may have say him anyway to not risk reinjury, but his 29.5 point performance really would have helped. Instead I went with JK Dobbins (20.1) who broke a long TD at some point in the game (IDK, didn't watch). That's promising since athletes that sit out a year due to injury as Dobbins has multiple times often lose that explosive element to their game. CMC jr (Jordan Mason) followed the Shana-plan and racked up and easy 17.4 points contributing with DK's 10-129-1 line for the Weiners. Another Tua concussion sadly led to a combined 12.1 points for him and Tyreek. Why doesn't that man wear a guardian cap? Do those look weird to anyone? Idk I haven't been watching. Bill properly handcuffed KW3's ankle injury with 17.9 from Charbonet. Malik Nabers (28.7) threw down against the worst defense in the league lifting up bad outings from Aiuyuk (8.9) and Kelce (1.5 ouch). Heading into Monday night, Steve needed ~15 from Drake London, a seemingly easy task for a WR1. The night started slow for London and the Falcons. A tush push with <5 minutes left put the Eagles ahead and set the Falcons up with one final drive. Luckily for Steve and the Falcons, Cousins led a GW drive with the GW TD to DL for ATL.

The Steagles (161.52) toasted Sesame Seed Sons (108.94). The Sons saw double digit games from only 3 players: Lamar, Kyren, and Nico "Texans WR1" Collins. Anthony Richardson (9.86) had a rough stat line in his loss to GB. I saw a tweet that according to next gen stats, Richardson has less completions against man coverage (1) than interceptions (2). With an 0-2 start and a superstar like Joe Flacco behind him, AR better watch his back. James Cook started off the week strong for the Steagles with 3 total TDs (28.5). Hurts (23.82) and Barkley (17.6) will be an interesting duo to watch this year for the Steagles as both are prolific goal line runners. As long as the Eagles offense keeps up, Shea should though neither were necessary in this stomping.

Chumpion (166.32) prevailed in the second closest matchup of the week against Ouchie (161.22). Chumpion continues to roll with the Buccaneers passing game in Baker (18.8), Godwin (24.7) and Evans (7.2). MHJ (29) arrived on the NFL scene with a pair of first half TDs and Breece lightning (24.4) helped the Jets pull ahead of the Titans despite trailing early. Ouchie had a decent showing this week hard carried by the Saints demolition of the Cowboys. Kamara (44 points and 4 TDs) was untouchable (I think, I didn't watch the game) as the Saitns dropped 35+ in the first half of both their games. Injuries to CMC / AJ Brown prior to the week let T. Johnson (4) slip into the starting lineup of an 8 team league. Mixon (8) was also injured on a hip drop tackle and really hurt ouchies chances this week. Justin Herbert is listed as questionable but I didn't see any tweets about him. 

Amon Ra Dog (151.78) pulled ahead of Token Female (137.28). Their namesake has a typical 10+ for 100+ week followed closely by Devante Smith (20.6) who thrived in the absence of AJ Brown. Cooper Kupp (7.7) left the game early for Amon Ra Dog but was one of only 3 single digit performances. Token Female experienced their own injury ailments with Deebo (18), JJ (23.3), and Pacheco (16.1). However, it was their uninjured players which underperformed led by Mahomes (12.94), Michael Pittman Jr (5.4), and Zack Moss (5.7). One of these teams was going to start 0-2, yet it's still pretty early in the year.

# Predictions

Last week I went 2-2 for a hot 6-2 start. This week's winners will be: Alan's One Win Weiners, Sesame Seed Sons, Chumpion (picking them any time the Bucs have a + matchup), Amon Ra Dog (Derrick Henry 150+ and 2), and all "prove you're a human" captchas Bill encounters this week.
