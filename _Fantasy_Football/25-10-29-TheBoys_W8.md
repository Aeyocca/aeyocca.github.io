# Parity

One week past the halfway point of the regular season and things could not be tighter. Nine of the twelve teams are 3-5 to 5-3. If the season ended today, three 4-4 teams would miss the playoffs.

## Data nugget

This week we look at the number of times we start QB, WR, RB, or TE at the superflex spot. 

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/21-24_superflex_starts.png" alt="">

We all choose QB over the other positions a vast majority of the time unsurprisingly. We see Taylor's magic year drafting four top 10 WRs shot up his WR starts. Jeremy has never started a RB or TE in the superflex spot. while TEs have only earned the honor four total times (at least five now, these data don't include this year yet). Jeff has started a RB in the superflex the most times in the entire league and he's only done it 4 times over the 42 regular season games from 2022-2024.

Also a fun nugget while plotting the data initially I saw Cody and I had a week where neither of us started a player in the superflex splot. Apparently it was week 14 in 2023 where it didn't affect playoff standings so I played Cooper Kupp (25.5) against Puka (14) in Puka's rookie year where they were both on the Rams, Puka was the WR4, Kupp was the WR40 (4 games missed to injury), and Kupp outscored Puka only 3 times in the 13 weeks prior to that week. I went on to get stomped in the Semis and sneak out a 115-113 third play victory against Em. Good times.

Lets also look at the FLEX splot.

I think this is even more interesting. Most of us love to play WRs in the flex. It seems about half the league have started a RB at least 1/3rd of the time while Jeremy loves him some TEs (dude same). Zach may be telling us something, having won back to back championships flexing RBs the majority of the time. Instead of suggesting thats what we all should do, its probably because he's so dang good at drafting good RBs that are worth starting. Last year, his championship squad had JT (RB12 - 2nd round), DH (RB4 - 4th round), Bucky Irving (RB13 - $0 Faab the day before the season started), and Rico Dowdle (RB23 - 10th round). In 2023, he had Kyren (RB7 - 14th round), Kamara (RB11 - traded for), and Rachaad White (RB4 - 6th round). Something to think about in next years draft.

## Transactions

Somebody trade me defenses so I can at least feel something.

Waivers were hot this week with Devin Singletary ($20) going to Token Female uncontested. Michael Penix ($6) went to Mike's team and a total of $19 were bid across the Broncos, Lions, and Rams DST. There were a flurry of moves Wednesday morning as well as we all seem to be getting cheaper as the season goes on. Maybe Jeff should start allowing $0 bids before waivers run...

## Matchups

Too Many Bengals (174.22) bested Team Waiver Wire (144.44). In a matchup of the highest against third highest weekly score, fantasy point abounded. TMB finally has a functional Bengals offense thanks to 18 year vet Joe Flacco moving the ball at will. Ja'Marr Chase (21.1) is getting targeted no matter how many DBs surround him while Chase Brown (25.5) can finally run against defenses respecting the passing game. Also running against defenses respecting the pass was Team Waiver Wire's Kimani Vidal (19.7) who racked up most of his production after the Vikings were gashed by Justin Herbert's arm. Team Waiver Wire's Drake Maye (27.28) is on fire, scoring 20+ points in all but 2 weeks thanks to another what feels like a weekly 30+ yard TD. TMB's Jordan Love (28.3) edged out the second year player in fantasy points this week while playing the swiss cheese Steeler's defense. Tucker Kraft (33.3) accumulated over 130 yards after the catch and two scores for Team Waiver Wire. Rough games from Carson Wentz (8.76), Quinshon Judkins (4.7, shoulder injury), and Matthew Golden (3.4) started to put this matchup out of reach. TMB had a pair of TDs from Javonte (17.9) and Goedert (17.8) accounting for 67% of those players' fantasy output not including yardage and points per reception on those plays. What really put TMB over the top was the Buccaneers DST (27) who beat the Saints into benching Spencer Rattler for a lack luster Tyler Shough. Cody was too much of a coward up 14 points headed into Monday night to sit both Rashee and JKM against the Chiefs DST (12), so he came out the victor as a weenie rather than a tough guy. He ended Team Waiver Wire's 4 game winning streak while extending their own streak to the same mark.

LamaRB1 and the Funky Bunch (114.02) intercepted Hamas Rockets (72.34). Due to the bye-pocalypse 114 points was actually top half in the league this week. Mike had the Kyler-MHJ stack and BTJ on the bye with Lamar sitting out one more week with his hamstring injury. This led to the emergency start of Kirk Cousins (7.12) and two TEs (Schultz 4.4 / Otton 8). The Ravens offense without Lamar still functioned thanks to Pro Bowl QB Tyler Huntley targeting Flowers (14.1) nine times and leading an early Derrick Henry (19.1) scoring drive. The Rockets were busy Sunday morning and didn't catch the surprise Drake London inactive. We can't blame Jeremy for this one because I'm in two other leagues where London was also started this week. No Drake London for the Falcons? No competent passer? Against a near league worst Dolphins run defense? No problems for Bijan Robinson, he should have dominated right? Well it turns out if there's only a single good player on an offense its easy to stop them as Bijan averaged less than 3 yards per carry and scored only 5.8 fantasy points. The Rockets' surprise top performer was Tyjae Spears (17.2) who scored most of their fantasy points including a 3 yard TD run in garbage time. Jake Ferguson (0) was held catch-less in Denver on a single target after averaging over 8 targets per game entering the week (Ferguson is still the TE1 in full PPR). The Falcons defense not showing up against the Dolphins constituted the third scoreless player for Hamas Rockets. Being on pace for ~108 points outside of those three players makes it seem like a much better week than a sub 80 point day. What really put Mike over the top this week was Troy Franklin (26.9) walking freely through the Cowboys secondary, hauling in a pair of TD passes and carrying the Funky Bunch to 5-3.

Token Female (165.94) tore apart Team Tendonitis (111.36). Both teams had some big names enjoy their bye week while Token Female's active stars and depth players outperformed those of Team Tendonitis. Team Tendonitis had 5 of their 9 starters fail to crack double digits including surprisingly Emeka Egbuka (6.5) who was unnecessary against an inept Saints offense. Michael Pittman Jr. (23.5) and Patrick Mahomes (24.96) put together strong outings but just couldn't keep up with Token Female. Saquon Barkley (33.4) must have heard my complaint of the lack of long rushing TDs last week, as he ripped through the Giants secondary for a 65 yard rushing TD on the second play of the game. Barkley did exit early with a groin injury, but not before rushing for 150 yards. Breece Hall (32.86) had a field day against the Bengals with 133 rushing yards, two rushing TDs, and the game winning passing TD. If Fields won't do it I guess Hall will take matters into his own hands (though Fields did fine this week). Marring a strong victory for Token Female was an apparent season ending injury for Cam Skattebo (10). Skattebo was dragged down from behind as his cleat dug into the turf and turned his ankle about 120 degrees where it remained. Teammates averted their eyes and some grew emotional while the crayon eater reacted only annoyed as if he was at Applebee's and his appetizer was taking a little too long to arrive. Good night sweet prince, we'll see you again probably in the second round of next year's fantasy draft.

Some Whiffs Here And There (103.14) struggled to a win against I Digg Christians (100.58). Interestingly, neither team suffered from bye-pocalypse this week, their teams just mostly didn't show up aside from a few players. For IDC, Christian McCaffrey (9.8) could not get going against a solid Texans defense thanks to stellar ball control from the Texans offense (41:22 ToP). Dalton Kincaid (3.3) wasn't needed in a 40-9 shellacking of the Panthers and Andy Dalton (2.1) with the Bills pulling their starters early in the 4th quarter. Rome (18.4) and D'Andre Swift (15.1) were able to work against the Ravens even if it didn't lead to a Bears win while Bo Nix (24.78) was the weekly "I get to play the Cowboys" free square. For SWHAT, Baker Mayfield (4.08) almost could have taken a knee every snap as the Buc's defense outscored the Saints offense on Sunday. Meanwhile Jalen Hurts (25.36) passed for 4 TDs against an injured Giants secondary and Jonathan Taylor (37.4) continued to write his potential MVP resume. Taylor dropped his fourth 30+ point fantasy day, scoring three TDs in each of those four games. I considered checking this against historical references, but I see he gets to face the Steelers defense next week and the Falcons at home after that, so I think I'll wait until things inevitably get better. SWHAT had over half his squad playing Sunday and Monday night and was only down 11 points against just the Packers DST. It was so over after the 4pm games. Yet on Sunday night, one of SWHAT's players was the Steelers DST who dropped -7 against the Packers not registering a single sack or turnover and allowing 35 points. Romeo Doubs (9.4) played second fiddle to teammate Tucker Kraft and Jonnu Smith (3.7) was only targeted on two 3rd and long check downs. That left Pacheco and Worthy up against about 12 points. Despite over 400 yards for the Chiefs offense, it was a slow night for that duo who barely crossed the 12 point threshold with about 11 minutes left in the game.

$81k Team (133.34) had the pleasure of facing the league's worst record in Mrs Goff (110.96). Unsurprisingly, the team based on the Goff ARSB stack struggled to put up points this week especially since they were also down Kyren, Darnold, and Mike Evans. Of Mrs Goff's three Saturday signings, only Tyler Huntley (16.74) had a great day. Justice Hill (0.2) played third fiddle to DH and Keaton Mitchell and Xavier Legette (3.7) wasn't targeted until late in the game on Sunday. James Cook (33.6) was nearly unstoppable on the ground and CJ Stroud (22.72) threw for over 300 yards. It was a true team effort for $81k Team with the top scorer Josh Allen (23.22) having a pedestrian day for the reigning MVP and the Eagles DST (7) bringing up the rear. Rashid Shaheed (14.5) and De'Von Achane (20.1) had solid games while Evan Engram (7.6) was $81k Team's highest scoring TE since Bowers stopped playing in Week 4. A good game from DK Metcalf (16.5) put $81k Team close enough for Kareem Hunt (17.2) to close things out on Monday night, but for good measure Hunt made sure to score twice.

Team Jeff (110.18) shaved Mr. Big Chests (98.5). Both squads suffered groups of dud performances. MBC's Jordan Mason (1.6) had just 3 rushing yards on 4 carries on Thursday night while Rico Dowdle (5.4) apparently needs Bryce Young to get going. Jeff answered Mason's performance with a full goose, not even being targeted while Alvin Kamara (6.5), like Dowdle, suffered from a lack of first downs. MBC got 14.3 more points out of Kittle in his second week back off IR and Pickens (14.8) saw steady targets despite a struggling Dak. Team Jeff won the week off the back of a shootout between his QBs. Joe Flacco (24.32) impressively built a multiscore lead against the Jets (its not surprising anymore, but is it even still impressive?). The lead was built in part thanks to a 44 yard Higgins TD on his only catch of the game. In comes what felt like the Garbage Man in Justin Fields (20.86) who only threw for one TD, yet collected a pair of two point conversions. Quick side note: down 14 points late, the Jets scored and went for 2. If you assume your offense has a 50% chance of scoring the two point, then theres a 75% chance you can score at least as many points necessary to tie the game and bake in the chance of winning the game outright, analytics says go for dos. The announcers in the game were absolutely baffled at Aaron Glenn's decision to go for two in this situation. Fields has now either scored more than 20 (4 times) or less than 5 points (3 times plus the bye) in his seven starts. Heading into Monday night, MBC needed a slight Miracle; 25 points from Mariota. With Mariota's rushing upside it would probably have required a pair of rushing TDs. Facing Kansas City at Arrowhead however proved too tough and the Manders only found the endzone once on an acrobatic grab from Terry McLaurin late in the first half while MBC found his first L in three weeks.

## Predictions

Lets not talk about last week, and just say the records are 27-21 and 32-16 for me and ESPN projections respectively. Alright whats going on here? How are the projections for the Wednesday rosters so hot this year? This week's Wednesday projection leaders are Team Waiver Wire, LamaRB1 and the Funky Bunch, IDC, Mrs Goff, $81k Team, and TMB. I'll take SWHAT over Mrs Goff, Token Female over Mike, and Team Tendonitis over IDC.

## Dad Joke of the Week

Dracula asked if he could join us trick or treating this year. I'm not sure how to let him down gently, but he can be a real pain in the neck.
