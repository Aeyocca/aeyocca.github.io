# Unexpected production

Early drafted running backs mostly failed to perform this week. Only 3 of the top 15 RBs this week were drafted in the 4th round or higher (Chubb, Barkley, Henry). The rest were drafted 6th or later. Also, only 7 of the top 15 were started with 7 riding benches and 1 on waivers (Edmonds). The top 15 WRs were more sporadic (though that might be expected at this position). 7 of the top 15 WR this week are on waivers, 3 were drafted in the first 6 rounds, and 5 were on the bench (should have been 4 because I sat CeeDee for some reason..)

## Waiver wire / trades

The most expensive add of the week was Romeo Doubs ($12) who went to Jesus Christ Superstars without competition. Red Solo Kupp shelled out $7 for the chance at the defense facing Brian Hoyer (GB). BCLR bid $3 on Greg Dortch but they set priorities to end up with Chase Edmonds instead. Dortch went to the Weiners for $1 because Cody doesn't know how to manage so no free transactions.

There was a single trade last week, with the Weiners finally moving their accidental 9th round pick.

## A few key plays

Alan's Two-Win Weiners (128.36pts) defeated Red Solo Kupp (123.38pts), though with some crazy plays, it could've gone either way. The week started Thursday night with Nick Chubb (17.3pts) sneaking into the endzone after 3 straight failed Kareem Hunt attempts. The Weiners accidentally started the Brown DST (10pts) who got 8 points on the final hook and ladder play. In the Raiders Titans game, Davante Adams missed on all 3 targets on their final drive for RSK, while Darren Waller got rocked trying to haul in a deep pass late for the Weiners. RSK's Josh Allen missed bad on a game winning TD pass to Isaih Mackenzie late in the game on 4th and goal. Mahomes losses to the Colts throwing an INT while targetting RSK's JuJu on the last play. The Weiner's Allen Robinson II dropped a wide open TD pass late. Heading into Sunday night, the Weiners needed 20 combined points from Javonte Williams and Zeke. Javonte underperformed (9pts) but a rushing TD by Zeke late in the 3rd quarter sealed it for the weiners.

## Go birds... again

Jesus Christ Superstars (157.66pts) dropped the highest total of the week against Injury Tent (Out) (108.28pts). It was another strong week for the Ravens duo. In the last two weeks, Lamar Jackson and Mark Andrews have combined for 136.64 points which is ~29% of JCS' total Points For (.. its for, not forced ya jagoffs). Injury Tent couldn't get much going with single digit performances from Gabe Davis (6.7pts), Michael Thomas (9.9pts; left early), and Pat Freiermuth (6.1pts on two 4th quarter catches). Dalvin Cook (13.6pts) also dislocated their shoulder during the game but he's been doing that every year. You ain't that injured, change your name back and you might win a few games. Or you could try not playing the highest scorer on the week.

## Underperformers

Broncos Country Let's Ride (98.14pts) sneaked past Runnin Kupp That Hill (97.2pts) in this week's toilet bowl. This matchup saw only 7 players (out of 18 total) outperform their projection, and those that did only outscored it by an average of ~3.2pts. Defenses almost made a huge difference. The Ravens DST for RKTH got a few points late despite giving up 26 points. BCLR started the 32nd ranked DST by 5 points as the Chargers got smacked by the Jaguars 38-10. Going into Sunday night, BCLR needed ~26pts from Sutton and Russ. Much like the Broncos this season, BCLR got just enough points to pull past and get to 2-1.

## Undefeated no more

The '72 Dolphins are celebrating early this year after Team Tallman Kiss My A$$ (125.7pts) took down Seattle Krakens (95.42pts). The Krakens had a 21.22pt advantage at the QB position and Team Tallman's David Montgomery injured their ankle after just 1.1pts. However the Eagles DST came up big with 9 sacks against Carson Wentz. The Krakens had an RB injury of their own as Swift hurt their shoulder after just 7.6pts and a pair of disappointments at WR with Jerry Jeudy (3.7pts) and Jahan Dotson (3pts) coming up short. Each team benched a top 6 WR on the week as mentioned earlier (Devonta Smith / Chris Olave).

## At least Pitts showed up

Token Female (114.98pts) slugged their way to victory of Wide Tiddys Tied Biddys (92.46pts). Token Female's players all finished pretty close to projections, except Justin Herbert (12.58pts) and his cracked rib cartiledge. Kudos to Token Female for stubbornly sticking with Dawson Knox at TE despite finishing as the weekly TE 48, 18, and 22 (24th overall). On the other side, Kyle Pitts came through after finishing as the weekly TE 35, 28, and now 6 (15 overall). However that's all that went right with WTTB. Joe Flacco came back to Earth with 3.4pts against Cincinatti, and their three starting RBs drafted 25th (Mixon), 32nd (Jones), and 36th (Conner) overall combined for 21.2pts. They now sit as the RB 16, 7, and 28 respectively. At 0-3 WTTB wants this ship to turn around quickly, though they are at 32% playoff probability and 6/10 teams make it to the dance.


## Predictions

Last week I rebounded for 4-1 in predictions for a total of 7-8. ESPN projections went 2-3 for a total of 5-10.
This week winners will be: "Alan's One-Win Weiners", "Seattle Krakens", "WTTB", "JCS", and "Token Female"
