# To QB or not to QB

Week one to me seemed a bit light on QB scoring. I remember hearing last year the first few weeks of the season lean offense heavy as defenses tend to take longer to play better together. If that held this year, it was more on the ground than through the air as the QB1 scoring cutoff was 16.1 points (Jimmy G), and the QB2 cutoff 9.2 points (Zach Wilson, as we all expected). Lets compare that to this week's RB3 cutoff (8 points - Jahmyr Gibbs, sad) and WR3 cutoff (11.3 - Deebo Samuel). Something to keep in mind moving forward. This week was within division games only so congrats to those getting a leg up on your division mates. That trend will continue for the next 4 weeks as we continue the round robin. So if you're in the better Red Bull division, don't worry, your competition will get much easier Week 6.

## Matchups

Michael Ohers Conservator (129.98) reallocated the finances of Dude, Where's My Carr? (116.14). This was a tight matchup heading into Sunday night with the Conservators down nearly 40 points with only a defense and Garrett Wilson left to play. The Cowboys defense (35) nearly got the job done themselves. Lets hope the Conservator's starters remain  healthy as their 7 bench players combined for a total of 8.3 points. Dude, Where's my Carr? (DWMC) put up a decent week led by Travis Etienne (21.4) and Mike Evans (18.6). However, the DJ Moore Justin Fields stack combined for only 2 targets and only 20.04 points. I imagine Moore will be a focus of the offense next week however. DWMC's bench was strikingly more productive than the Conservator's with 81.52 points, good enough to beat this week's lowest scorer.

I Pickens Boogies (130.9) put up the week's third highest score against Team Jeff (105.7). Team Jeff only had 2 players outscore their projections (Tony Pollard - 22.2; Brian Robinson - 13.6). The rest of the squad mostly didn't bomb sans Daniel Jones's Sunday night stomping (6.46). Honestly I'm impressed Jones got to the 6.46 mark, then I remember interceptions are only -1 in this league, and Jones was credited with 13 carries for 43 yards. The Boogies on the other hand had a handful of big performances from JJ (24) and Ekeler (26.4). Forgoing the top QBs in rounds 1 and 2, these players instead scored enough to be the QB3 and QB2 respectively. Its not that simple, but that strategy worked well this week.

Cmac at #9? (116.18) survived against PP Hurts (88.8). The PPs had a decent foundation with Nick Chubb (16.7), Raheem Mostert (13), and SF DST (14). The rest of the squad however didn't live up. The ghost of Broken PPs also haunted the team this week by snapping Aaron Rodgers' (0) achilles and concussing Tyler Lockett (3). Cmac at #9 also had 5 players not living up to expectation, and even lost a point by starting the Dolphins defense in the closest thing the NFL had to a shootout this week. Starting a QB in that shootout (Tua - 28.14) more than compensated, cruising their team to a fantasy W.

Russia Invaders (79.46) failed to show up this week against Token Female (118.6). The Invaders dominated this week's dud list with Dak Prescott (6.32), Saquon (9.3), Tee Higgins (honk), and Kittle (4.9). If your players are going to dud, lets hope they get it all out in the same week. Token Female however experienced no major disappointments as no one scored less than 5 points below projections. Stefon Diggs (26.2) led the way. Though their runningbacks (Akers and James Cook) combined for only 75 yards on 44 carries, they outscored the Invaders starting widerecievers and left Token Female undefeated.

It didn't take long this year, but we have our first second highest scorer (Los Gatos Kitties - 130.98) failling to the highest scorer (Mr. Big Chest - 142.64). The Bijan experience (20.3) started off on the right note. It was scary that Tyler Allgeier received more opportunities than Robinson (18 - 16), but Bijan looked the part to me; damn near untacklable. The Kitties' other workhorse back Josh Jacobs struggled to get going against Denver averaging only 2.5 yards per carry and scoring 9.1 points. The rest of the squad was solid including a 21 point game for the Jets against Josh Allen, but it was enough against MBC. MBC was carried to victory on the shoulders of Reek the Freak (44.5). On the first play of the game, Tyreek lined up in the slot, looked at his QB, then looked across the line of scrimmage to see Khalil Mack lined up across him shrugging his shoulders with palms in the air beckoning to the safety for help. The help was too late, and Hill caught a short in pass for 16 yards. Tight coverage later in the game didn't matter much highlighted by Hill's 35 yard touchdown with a cornerback draped over him. The total? 11 catches, 215 yards, and 2 TDs. That was enough to earn MBC high scorer of the week and a 1-0 start.

Its Zach's second toilet bowl victory of the week! defeating Bidet or Be Gay 104.2 to 96.86. Half of the Zach White Commanders' team were respectable while the other half scored 4 or fewer points than projected. Shoutout to all the Christian Kirk (1.9) truthers. Don't shy away yet as Kansas City is next up. The Commanders at least might have a budding star RB on the bench (Kyren Williams - 17.4) who played himself into relevance Sunday massively outproducing Cam Akers. Bidet or Be Gay was let down by the Bengals stack of Joe Burrow (3.18) and Ja'Marr Chase (9.1). Steve picked the wrong Chiefs WR in Skyy Moore (0.4) with Rashee Rice (11.6) on the bench. At least Aaron Jones (26.7) popped off, but unfortunately on a 35 yard TD catch he also popped his hamstring and might be out next week in what should be a run heavy game against the Falcons.

The Offers Report this week saw 26 total claims totaling $307. The Puka Nacua sweepstakes was won by Michael Ohers Conservators. They have a great lawyer, but it cost them $81 FAAB. The next highest winning bid was Joshua Kelley for $11 to Cmac at #9?

## Predictions

We're starting off hot at 4-2 last week! ESPN projections are sitting in my rearview mirror at 3-3. This week winners will be: Michael Ohers Conservators, Cmac at #9? (for sure if Ekeler injured), Russia Invaders, Token Female, Zach White Commanders, and Mr. Big Chest (until Tyreek scores less than 30)
