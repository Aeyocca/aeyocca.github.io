# Parity continues

Five weeks in, 8/10 teams are either 2-3 or 3-2. Team Tallman sits on top at 4-1 and Wide Tiddy's Tide Biddys falls to 0-5 though ESPN still has him at a 10% chance at the playoffs.

## Waiver wire / trades

Waivers were busy, but the bids were low (highest bid $8). Four teams went after Jakobi Meyers and he ended up back with the team that drafted him (JCS). BCLR also had a fire sale, swapping out 5 players on waivers while also taking a swing at Meyers.

There were two trades last week

|-----------------+--------------|
| "Wide Tiddys Tied Biddys" | "Team Tallman Kiss My A$$" |

## Who needs TEs

Alan's Two-Win Weiners (111.86pts) flushed Seattle Kraken (99.72pts) in this week's toilet bowl. The Weiners got big games from Holywood Brown (21.8) and Jalen Hurts (27.66) who now has 6 rushing TDs and only 4 passing TDs through 5 games. The Weiners' Darren Waller (goose) pulled his hammy on the 6th play of the game Monday night, but they had about a 30pt lead heading into that Monday night game. The Kraken couldn't capitalize on the TE advantage as TJ Hockenson scored just 1.6pts following his massive 39pt bomb last week. The Kraken also accidentally started the Steelers DST (-4) who got decimated Sunday. The Kraken are down their top two RBs still (JT and Swift) but an injury to Damien Harris means Rhamondre Stevenson should be fantasy relevant in the future.



## Predictions

Last week I went 3-2 in predictions for a total of 10-15. ESPN projections went a perfect 5-0 for a total of 11-14.
This week winners will be: "Alan's Two-Win Weiners", "Red Solo Kupp", "Runnin Kupp That Hill", "BCLR" (both teams will underscore projection), and "JCS"
