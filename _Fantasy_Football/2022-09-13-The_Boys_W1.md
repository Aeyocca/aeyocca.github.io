# Welcome to superflex?

This is our league's inagural superflex year, and those of us who played superflex before claim "you can't win in superflex without two good quarterbacks". We chastized those that didn't draft them early, and now in week 1 the QB 24 scored <15pts and the QB12 scored <20pts. QB scoring differences did not affect this week's outcomes.
