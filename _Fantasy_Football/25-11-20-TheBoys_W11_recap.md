# Scoreboard watching

You're going to need 7 wins to make the playoffs, and even then you may need some points for tie breakers. 7 teams sit 6-5 or 5-6 so its wide open. Gotta love parity. Though not mathematically eliminated, Im calling Taylor and Jers seasons over. GLHF.

## Data nugget

The Sleeper platform lists each team's start accuracy (# of scored points / # of total possible points). With our league data, that's a straight forward enough thing to calculate. 

|-----------------+--------------|
| Owner | Average Score | Avg. Best Ball score | Start Accuracy |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|
| AY | 131.12 | 151.60 | 86.49% |
| CC | 121.82 | 137.96 | 88.30% |
| CM | 119.74 | 137.19 | 87.28% |
| DW | 136.00 | 149.19 | 91.15% |
| EM | 121.77 | 136.17 | 89.42% |
| JK | 112.69 | 130.37 | 86.44% |
| JR | 119.47 | 135.34 | 88.27% |
| MF | 109.07 | 128.44 | 84.92% |
| MR | 130.45 | 147.43 | 88.48% |
| SH | 130.47 | 147.72 | 88.32% |
| TN | 117.75 | 135.30 | 87.03% |
| ZW | 126.89 | 139.13 | 91.20% |
|-----------------+--------------|

I think this conclusively shows I've had the best rosters from 2022 - 2024 (or just love rostering WRs). Dave and Emily are the only ones above a 90% start accuracy so kudos to them. Max had a rough stretch in this league through these years including some major injuries. I think that reflects in both his low score and low best possible score. 

Next week lets consider how each team's playoff appearances would change if this were a superflex league.

## Transactions

TRADE ALERT! I REPEAT, TRADE ALERT!

This one mostly makes sense, Zach needed a RB for JT's bye week. However with JT on the Roster it seems adding Indiana Jones might cap his upside. Also it potentially cost him a win this week depending on who he would have started instead of White (Kupp or Dortch). But what do I know? I'm managing literally one of the worst teams in this league. Which reminds me, I'm in a 14 team league, PRR, one flex, no superflex but we do have kickers, in which I have 4 more points for through 11 weeks than I do in this league... Also in that league QBs get -1 for taking a sack and I've started bad QBs averaging less than 5 points from week 1-10.

We've had our first hot waiver wire commodity in Emmanuel Wilson. 5 bids totalling $63 ended in a $25 add for IDC. Dave swapped out 4 players at his 5am parenting shift, but at least only spent 8 minutes doing so this week.


## Matchups

I Digg Christians (110.22) kept up excavation of Team Waiver Wire's (82.04) grave. Scoring opened up Thursday night with IDC's Stefon Diggs (19.5) and Team Waiver Wire's Drake Maye (15.44). Diggs started the night as a line of scrimmage merchant, earning targets barely 5 yards past the line of scrimmage. As the game opened up, however, so did his depth of target as Diggs put up a solid game. Maye continued to play at a high level but had two redzone drives end in rushing TDs, limiting his output. On Sunday, Team Waiver Wire's Nico Collins (24.2) continues to benefit from Stroud's absence as Davis Mills hyper targets the WR1 (25 in the last two games combined). That was literally the peak of Team Waiver Wire's day, however. In what shouldn't at all be surprising, JJ McCarthy (8) is playing like a rookie QB. Rookie QBs rarely can support elite WR production which also reduces Justin Jefferson's output (11.1). Kimani Vidal (3.2) left the game for a stint with an injury yet the Chargers got rolled by the Jags defense regardless. IDC had their own duds with Luke Musgrave (0.9) finishing the game with -1 receiving yards. Rome Odunze and Swift combined for only 15.1 points in a defensive battle against the Vikings, and Bo Nix (12.6) threw no passing TDs. Though IDC could have won without him, CMC (35.1) enjoyed a trio of TDs in Brock Purdy's return against the Cardinals and put IDC in the top half of scorers for the week.

Mrs Goff (112.36) defied expectations against Mike's team (93.12). Part of my inkling of Mike's demise was the Ravens superstack facing the Browns defense, or rather facing Myles Garrett. Garrett wrecked another game for the opposing offense, holding Lamar (6.72) to less than 200 passing yards and 2 interceptions on Garrett's four sack performance. I saw a stat online saying he is only the third player with multiple four sack games in a season since 1982, and is the only player to have lost both games. Derrick Henry (20.2) was productive with 100 yards and a score. With BTJ out, Mike rolled with the Jag's new addition in Jakobi Meyers to the tune of 11.4 fantasy points, a mark BTJ has only surpassed twice this year. Mrs Goff's running back room was solid on Sunday with James Cook (20.4) and Kyren (16.6) each scoring. Sam Darnold (8.26) had a Jets-esque statline with 4 interceptions but still managed to drive the Seahawks into game winning FG range just for their kicker to badly whiff a 61 yard attempt. Mrs Goff had four players on Sunday and Monday night. Thanks to a slow day from Mike which included injuries to Josh Jacobs (4) and Michael Penix Jr (7.9), Mrs Goff's players only needed to average 8 points for a win. The Goff-ARSB stack had one of their worst fantasy combos (19.3) of the season against an Eagles defense that looked just like the one from their Super Bowl run, yet still crossed the 8 point threshold. That left CeeDee (17.6) and Tre Tucker (14.7) an easy job Monday night that they both crushed with a receiving TD a piece.

Too Many Bengals (113.48) surged past Some Whiffs Here and There (106.26). Like everyone this week, both teams struggled on Sunday. Jonnu Smith literally goosed for SWHAT followed closely by Xavier Worthy (5.5) who may still be injured. Rodgers (9.44) in replacement for recently traded Jalen Hurts left early with a wrist injury, but Kenny G (29.5) filled in nicely as Jaylen Warren was also injured. Mason Rudolf's favorite play was the chip and leak check down to Gainwell who hauled in 7 catches for 81 receiving yards and 2 TDs. Too Many Bengals in the same game had Chase Brown (18.7) who seems to only be able to run the ball against the Steelers, and Ja'Marr Chase (6) who was actually covered. Wow. What a concept. Travis Etienne Jr. (19.3) was the lead back for a team that stomped the Chargers thanks to an early Bhayshul Tuten exit, and Jordan Love effectively passed the ball effectively against the Giants. Baker Mayfield (17.82) for SWHATC had a decent start to the game as the Bucs turned over Josh Allen twice early, but was slowed by the Bills defense for most of the second half. Heading into Monday night, TMB needed only 27 points from Dak and Javonte combined, yet given the scoring this week nothing was guaranteed. Luckily for TMB, the Raiders looked like a peewee footbal team and Dak threw the ball at will to the tune of 268 yards and 4 passing TDs while Javonte rushed for 93 yards.

Team Jeff (103.9) crawled past Team Tendonitis (100.66). Jeff opened up his week with Justin Fields (19.34) against a tough Patriots defense. Fields led an opening drive rushing TD, but quickly turned back into a pumpkin. We know Fields is a poor passer of the ball, we've seen it first hand as Steelers fans. But I swear the past month he's looked worse. After the snap, Fields stares down the primary read, if he thinks he's open, he winds up about four seconds, then throws an off-target fast ball every time. When you rush the ball 10+ times every game though you can still end the week the week as a top 5 QB, but not when you're benched! On Sunday, Jeff's Tyrone Tracy Jr. (17.9) was moving like his 2024 self, and Deebo Samuel (20.7) in Madrid had his first 20+ point game since week 5. Team Tendonitis didn't have much go right early on Sunday as Jaylen Warren (8.7) left early with an ankle injury and Jerry Jeudy (5.1) who apparently needs Dillon Gabriel to be relevant. Davante Adams (7.1) must have been battling the oblique injury he suffered last week as he caught only one of his eight targets. Fortunately for Team Tendonitis, it was the unstoppable Stafford-Adams goal line fade. Adams now leads the league in TD catches if you can believe that (10). TT's biggest stud was Trey McBride (27.5). I think Kyler is a half decent QB, but Jacoby Brissett is making him look really bad right now. Brissett is like the Jameis Winston of days past in the sense he may not be great for his teams win column, but he is fantasy gold for the rest of his offense. Jacoby on Sunday set an NFL record for completions with 47 with 10 going to the TE1. This matchup was tight heading into Sunday night thanks in part to Jeff's Flacco (10.86) Higgins (15.3) stack underperforming especially relative to the Young (31.82) T-Mac (33) combo on the bench. After a surprisingly good fantasy game from Gibbs (19.6) given how bad the Lions' offense was, Team Jeff still needed just 6 points from Jeanty on Monday night. Unfortunately for Jeff, Jeanty rushed the ball 6 times for only 7 yards. Fortunately for Jeff, Jeanty earned a career high 8 targets and pulled in 6 checkdowns for 27 yards. Thank you PPR gods. 

$81k Team (129.92) squashed Hamas Rockets (108.7). Each team were part of rare company this week having a 30+ point player. Bijan Robinson (30) for the Rockets had a strong game with a pair of rushing TDs, having only one snaked by Allgeier this week. Josh "The Stallion" Allen (44.68) had a slow start against the Bucs, but put the team on his back (literally) with three rushing TDs, at least two of which were designed QB runs. The Rockets also had a good game from Drake London (18.9), but that was about it. Matt Stafford (13.2) passed for only 130 yards against the Seahawks and David Montgomery (4.7) had a rough night in Philadelphia though he did average 4.5 yards per carry. $81k Team's DK Metcalf (9.9) didn't score and therefore didn't crack double digits while Wandale Robinson (7.6) only caught 4 of his 9 targets. De'Von Achane (21.5) picked up the rest of the squad however followed closely by Ken Walker III (20.1). Walker had his best game of the year and cracked double digits for the first time since week 4 thanks to a rushing TD. Heading into Monday night, the Rockets were pretty far out of it with the Cowboys' Ferguson against Brock Bowers down almost 20 points. The Raiders were inept and the Cowboys moved the ball at will, however Bowers still put up a solid stat line (7 for 72) and Ferguson only crept up to 16 yards.

Mr Big Chests (155.62) bested Token Female (122.56) in the only matchup this week with two respectable teams. MBC was off the to races Thursday night with three TDs from rookie TreVeyon Henderson (32.3). Things slowed down for him on Sunday though with RJ Harvey (8) predictably struggling against the Chiefs defense with only 30 rushing yards and Ladd (4.3) going down with the Chargers' offensive ship. Luckily for MBC, Token Female had Justin Herbert (4.34) who also could do almost nothing against the Jaguars' pass rush. The Chargers offensive line struggles are finally catching up to them. Thankfully after they bye they face Las Vegas, but after that its Philly and Kansas City to open up the playoffs. Good thing Token Female is cruising towards the bye. Token Female's Puka Nacua (14.3) had a down week for him but still caught seven passes for over 50% of Stafford's passing yardage. Travis Kelce (24.1) thrived in Denver, and the Steelers' D/ST (23) put up a pair of defensive TDs against Joe Flacco's Bengals. This matchup was in favor of MBC heading into Sunday night, but with Barkley and DeVonta against MBC's Hurts, perhaps some long rushing TDs and repeated targets to Smith could even the score. Sadly for Token Female, it was a defensive battle that produced a single rushing TD.. for Jalen Hurts (14.5). On Monday, MBC just needed 8 points from the Cowboys D/ST and Pickens (29.4) and got more than enough in the first half. Did you guys see the Pickens TD? After a very rounded in cut, Pickens caught the ball and cut it outside. While seemingly jogging towards the sideline Pickens saw the safety take a horrid angle at him, turned his head and made a sharp cut infield making the safety miss by about 5 yards and walked untouched into the endzone.

## Predictions
We both went 3-3 last week so its 38-28 against 42-23. ESPN projected winners are: Mrs Goff, Team Jeff, Team Tendonitis, Hamas Rockets, Token Female, and MBC. Gimme myself and SWHTC instead.

## Dad Joke of the Week

If you didn't know, I study plant genetics, so it was a weird request for me at work the other day when they asked my to combine the DNA of a cheetah and a crab. Things ended up going sideways pretty fast.
