## Clear Winners and Clear Losers
The average margin of victory this week was 27pts! with the closest matchup being a 9.5pt game. Its going to be hard to make the write ups that dramatic this week.

SaQuads (164pts) cruised past Team Jeff (97pts) with a true team effort. Davante Adams (12.7pts) had the worst showing, but three players had multiple touchdowns, and SaQuads had a TE break double digits for the first time this year (Gesicki; 16.7pts). Not much more to say than the stars aligning for SaQuads in this one. I guess thats why they decided to blow up the team (see Trade recap). Team Jeff slides to 1-3, yet he joins four other teams (!) so their season is far from over.

BooBoo SmithSchloopster (115pts) remains undefeated with their win over Token Female (102pts). Token Female had a 15pts advantage at DST and Davis "Nathan Peterman" Mills had an embarassing 4 interception performance against the bears. Ironic since Peterman was the Bills' QB for his 4 int game against the Chargers a few years ago. This advantage wasn't enough to overcome SmithSchloopsters start power, as they were carried by Kyler, Derrick Henry, and Justin Jefferson (25,26,20). Ben Roethlisberger is for some reason still on SmithSchloopster's bench. At least Ben is getting wins in somewhere this year.

Meme Team (130pts) took down Los Gatos (102pts) this week. Los Gatos were up 18pts Thursday night after James RB1nson (20pts) made an appearance and the Bengals defense (2pts) made T-Law look good. Disappointment from the stars marked Los Gatos' week as the DeAndre pair of Swift and Hopkins combined for only 19pts. I'm sounding like captain hindsight but it does never seem good when a head coach says a player will be more involved as Lions head coach Dan Campbell said earlier this week.

This week's clash of titans saw Dimes Szn Danny Juice (137pts) fall just short to Seven Eleven (146pts). Though Seven Eleven started D.J. Chark who fractured their ankle on the first series Thursday night, Tyreek "the freak" Hill put up enough points for the both of them, torching Philadelphia to the tune of 11-186-3 (47.6pts). Impressively, the Dimes Szn Danny Juice moniker has held for two weeks in a row. I'd have guessed he gets one good fantasy week then disappears, and still would take the under on his fantasy finish, but we shall see.

Afghanistan Feminists (112pts) took down Broken PPs (89pts). Neither team wanted to win it seems, as they both started DST that scored negative, and Broken PPs (NO; -1pt) still had a 5pts advantage at the position over the Feminists (CAR; -6pts). The Feminists even had "Scoredarrell" Patterson chilling on their bench with 34.6pts. Lets be fair to Broken PPs though, they put up almost 90 points without having a player drafter higher than 30th (Kittle) in this year's draft. 

Titty Tickler (83pts) was this week's free win with the least points scored. The Zach White Football Team (105pts) walked it in even though they were so short on RBs they had to start Jamaal Williams (7pts). I shouldn't laugh because I'm in the same boat in another league thanks to Joe Mixon's injury. Patrick Mahomes carried the day for the ZWFT with 35.5pts, and if there was any week for their recently acquired start WR Cooper Kupp to have a down week (11pts), it was against the Ticklers. The Tickler's coveted TE1 Kelce scored their least fantasy points in at least their last 10 games. Quite the anomoly with Mahomes throwing 5 TDs in that game. You know you're having a bad week when Robert Woods is your highest scoring skill position player (15pts). Member when Titty Tickler traded away Tyreek Hill this past week? I member.

This week's hot waiver commodity was Damien Williams with David Montgomery's injury. He seems to be out at least 4 weeks, possibly more. $151 was bid. Shoutout to Seven Eleven for the bid of $1. SaQuads sacrificed thier faab budget to get Williams for $71, a necessity as they are the Montgomery owner.

## Predictions update
For every matchup this season, I will pick a winner and keep track of ESPN's projected winner. ESPN's projected winner will be updated after the week in case of last minute substitutions, but I will make my picks based on starting roster each Wednesday.

Week 3 I went 4-2 for a total of 12-12. ESPN also went 5-1 and sits at 15-9. Man I'm getting smacked by ESPN projections. Here are my Week 5 winners:
"SaQuads", "Meme Team", "BooBoo SmithSchloopster", "Dimes Szn Danny Juice", "Afghanistan Feminists", and "Titty Tickler" (this was the toughest to call).
