Cherry popped! This is supposedly Team Tallman Kiss My A$$'s first ever fantasy football trade. Since that happened I guess I'm open to trading Kyler now.

## Predictions update
For every matchup this season, I will pick a winner and keep track of ESPN's projected winner. ESPN's projected winner will be updated after the week in case of last minute substitutions, but I will make my picks based on starting roster each Wednesday.

Week 4 I went 4-1 for a total of 13-7. On a roll here. ESPN projections went 2-3 for a total of 10-10. Here are my Week 5 winners:
"Alan's Wining Weiners", "Eating the Ws Until the Ls", "How Do I Butt Stuffed?", "Fields of Dreams", and "Tony Hawks Pro Facemasking"
