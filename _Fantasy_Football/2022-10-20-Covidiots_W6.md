# A day late

Sorry I'm bit late on the recap this week, I was too busy watching the Phillies blow a two run lead.

This week played out near perfectly for parity once again, with now 6 teams at 3-3, and Steve finally getting on the board. It was a fairly low scoring week though with the highest points being only 135.84pts (previous lowest high was 157). It was mostly runningbacks failing to produce this week. No one's highest scoring player was a RB. the RB20 (JaMycal Hasty) scored only 11.7, while the WR20 (Thielen) hit 15.6.


## Waiver wire / trades

Waivers were very busy as 14 claims were submitted for a total of $64, though 6 total claims for $41 were processed.

There was one trade this week and one power hungry commish that vetoed the second

## Underperformers

Broncos Country Let's Ride (123.12pts) easily handled Alan's Three Win Weiners (91.08pts). The Weiners were major underperformers as only the Vikings DST (8pts) outscored their projections. The Weiners left some big points on the bench this week (Lazard 17.6, Zeke 15.6, and Fields 18.4). BCLR had a dud from Jeff Wilson Jr. (0.5) who fumbled early and didn't come in for the pass heavy script as the 49ers were down 14 early to the Falcons. The Weiners matched that dud with Melvin Gordon's 3 carry for 8 yard evening as the Broncos prefer to roll with the 32 year-old Latavius Murray who has been on the roster for less than 2 weeks.

## Hot Hand

Team Tallman Kiss My A$$ (TTKMA; 100.98pts) extended his lucky win streak to 5 against Hindsight Lad (HSL; 89.94pts) one of the two teams scoring less than him this week. Tallman again started the week with a bad TNF performance, this time from Wentz (4.16) and David Montgomery (9). That performance was correlated with HSL's Curtis Samuel (2.6) who after starting the season as a top 10 WR is now sitting at WR22. HSL's recent trade lost him this week as CEH (3.3) and Tom Brady (13.72) were shipped for Cousins (16.5) and Cook (15.3). TTKMA finished the matchup with a typical good game from Kelce (19.2) and Staffords second highest scoring game of the year (11.82...). Hey a win is still a win

## A game of inches

Jesus Christ Superstars (135.84pts) squeaked out a victory against Running Kupp That Hill (135.76pts). This matchup could have swung either direction at many points. RKTH started one QB Skylar Thompson (4.46) who left the game in the first half. JCS's Saquon Barkley broke free late in the game and decided to not pull a Nick Chubb/Todd Gurley and took a knee at the 2 yardline instead of running in a TD. Heading into Monday night, RKTH needed 28.1pts from Mike Williams and Austin Ekeler combined. Mike Will struggled. He had 1 catch until the game's final drive. Austin Ekeler meanwhile racked up just enough points to come close. Denver muffed a punt in overtime at the 28 yardline. Two negative rushes from Ekeler and RKTH was 2pts shy. On the last offensive snap of the game, the Chargers drew up a screen to Mike Will for his 2nd catch of the night taking it 9 yards. One shy and JCS came out on top. One yard (3 passing yards), you love to see it.

## On the board

Wide Tiddys Tied Biddys (WTTB; 129.56pts) earned their first W against Seattle Krakens (119.82pts). The Krakens are still without their top two RBs (JT / Swift) but didn't suffer much at the position, starting Rhamondre Stevenson (25.1) and Travis Etienne (12.8). The Krakens even had week's highest scoring player (Burrow; 32.5) but got a dud from Tyler Higbee (1.7) and the Jags DST (-4). WTTB earned the win with their WRs combining for 57.2pts (Diggs & Pittman) and their top RBs combining for 35.8pts (Mixon & Walker). Next up for WTTB is a match with the league's highest scorer (JCS).

## TE1 szn

Token Female (120.86pts) defeated Red Solo Kupp (111.96pts). Token Female survived some sub par QB outings from Rodgers (11.84) and Herbert (8.42). TF finally got a top 10 performance from Dawson Knox (12.7) though they left the week's TE1 on the bench (Gesicki; 24.9). RSK boldy decided to start both Chubb (8) and Hunt (1.2) against the Patriots Defense who are 3rd best against fantasy RBs. However their best bench replacement was Corey Davis at 7.2pts.

## Predictions

Last week I went 2-3 in predictions for a total of 12-18. ESPN projections also went 2-3 for a total of 13-17.
This week winners will be: "Alan's Two-Win Weiners", "Runnin Kupp That Hill" (I wish both could lose, I'm mad 0 QB is working), "Jesus Christ Superstars", "Seattle Krakens" (especially if Waddle plays), and "BCLR"
