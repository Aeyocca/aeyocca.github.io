# Favorite side?

Whats the best Thanksgiving side dish? My vote with stuffing, but it has to have been roasted up the Turkey's ass. Mashed potatoes are a close second, and all vegetables aren't even in the same league.

We had three football games this year that were overall interesting. Everyone had some skin in the game except the Broken PPs. Let's start with the QBelievers (7-4) against Token Female (5-6). Token Female had a hot start with Josh Allen (30.92) who carried the ball 10 times for 78 yards. However, the Pats DST (1) couldn't stop the Vikings and superstar WR Justin Jefferson (29.34). The good news is Token Female started Dawson Knox who is the TE 7 on the week. The bad news is there are 13 games to be played, and Knox scored only 3.7pts. The QBelievers are sitting at 63.88pts to Token Female's 35.62pts, but the projections are still close.

Russia Invaders (3-8) had a whopping 5 players go on Thanksgiving including a bold Michael Gallup start (11.3) and a good game from Mac Jones (23.28). Their opponent BBSS (7-4) only had Daniel Jones play (14.52) who had a mediocre game. Russia Invaders are up to a 51% chance at victory which is better than their average so I'd take it. BBSS left "2 TD" Dalton Schultz on the bench also in favor of Juwan Johnson.

Mr. Big Chest (4-7) had a relatively disappointing game from Tony Pollard (8.1) as Zeke and Peyton Hendershot snaked goal line TDs. Team Jeff (4-7) matched Pollard with Devin Singletary (9) and had a PPR masterpiece from Rhamondre Stevenson (20.2; 36 rushing yards). TJ Hockenson (15.3) also scored putting Team Jeff up with a 59% chance at winning.

Los Gatos Kitties (6-5) had the only Thanksgiving player in their matchup against Broken PPs (4-7) even across either bench. Amon-Ra St. Brown (27.9) continued their dominance with 9 catches for over 100 yards. The guy's always open and I'm a little salty I played against him in another league so I feel your pain Max. Things ain't lookin good for the PPs with only a 33% chance at staying relevant.

Flushable's Not Flushable (7-4) had the boldest start of the week going with Jared Goff over Aaron Rodgers. It paid off as the Lions kept it close against Buffalo and Goff nabbed 2 TD passes and 17.6pts. Saquon (15.2) had a bad game for his standards. DCIAC (5-6) had a decent game from Captain Kirk (22.86) but a less than average score from Dallas DST (4) though at least they didn't go negative. Dallas DST is averaging 11.5pts through 11 games. They lost 3 points on the last garbage NYG TD with 8 seconds left to play. DCIAC is at a 38% chance to win but has Leonard Fournette who was recently declared doubtful still in their lineup.

In the matchup of The Tagovailorian (9-2) against the Zach White Commanders (4-7) it was WR1 (Diggs) vs. WR2 (Gabe Davis). Things were looking good for ZWC as Diggs was having a very quiet game. Then came 8 minutes to go in the 4th, and the Lions decided to stop covering the guy. Diggs finished with 8 catches for 77 yards and a TD after entering the 4th quarter with <25 yards. Gabe Davis had anoter deep miss and ended with only 4 for 38.
