# The_boys_week_2_recap

## Near perfect parity

2/3 of the league sits at 1-1 after two weeks with two big winners (BooBoo SmithSchloopster & ZWFT) and two big losers (Long Arms Alan & Fantasy TikTokkers). Most matchups this week weren't close, but there was plenty of heartbreak... especially for me.

Meme Team was in a bad spot entering Sunday night. Having traded away Cooper Kupp to their opposition Long Arms Alan, he dropped 36pts in his revenge game. Long Arms Alan sat with a 28pt deficit with their first two draft picks (Clyde Edwards-Helaire & Davante Adams) yet to play. However, CEH after a night with 13 carries ended with zero catches, zero touchdowns, and the game losing fumble. Davante Adams just needed 26pts to pull out a victory, yet fell just short at 20pts. Here's a short list from the 22 RBs Alan could have drafted instead of CEH to pull out a week 2 victory: Cordarelle Patterson, Tony Pollard, James White, Zack Moss, Demetric Felton (Browns RB3), Michael Carter, Phillip Lindsay.

Token Female (135pts) finally ended up in the win column, crushing Los Gatos (102pts). A 20pt advantage in the defense and special teams matchup definitely didn't help Los Gatos. Shout out to Token Female's starters for getting the job done, since their bench holds 4 players that didn't play this week (OBJ, Evan Engram, Will Fuller, Josh Jacobs).

BooBoo SmithSchloopster (176pts) layed down the hammer on Team Jeff (118pts). Actually, SmithSchloopster only needed four players to beat Team Jeff: Kyler Murray (39pts), Derrick Henry (48pts), TJ Hockenson (21pts), and Devin Singletary (17pts). Take away a 41.5pt effort from Aaron Jones, and SmithSchloopster could have won with only Murray and Henry!

In this week's toilet bowl, Titty Tickler (112pts) edged out Fantasy TikTokkers (104pts). Those 8 points came from two 6 inch forward passes on jet sweeps from Rodgers to Aaron Jones Monday night. 6 inches once again coming in clutch for the Titty Ticklers. This toilet bowl was marked by rough start/sit decisions, as each team left a pair of 20pt scorers on the bench: Henry Ruggs and Cortland Sutton for Titty Tickler; Tony Pollard and JD McKissic for Fantasy TikTokkers.

ZWFT (139pts) took care of business vs Iron City Wet Dreams (94pts) this week. ZWFT survived a horrific effort from their top two RBs Saquon Barkley (9pts) and Jonathan Taylor (6pts). Two TDs for the Buccaneers defense didn't hurt either. Iron City Wet Dreams can take solace in not being the lowest scorer of the week.

The lowest score of the week goes to Afghanistan Feminists (87pts) losing to I Hate Sand (109pts), now named Dimes Szn Danny Juice though they own zero shares of the NYG (update, Daniel Jones was added to the roster pre name change, I was only looking at rosters during the week 2 matchup). Afghanistan Feminists had several busts this week including Amari Cooper (5pts), Alvin Kamara (7pts), and Joe Mixon (8pts). I think they're bound to bounce back soon but this week #yousuck.

Waivers was a much less eventful affair this week with only $28 total dollars spent. Well that was $23 more than was necessary as no one bid on the same player.


## Predictions update
For every matchup this season, I will pick a winner and keep track of ESPN's projected winner. ESPN's projected winner will be updated after the week in case of last minute substitutions, but I will make my picks based on starting roster each Wednesday.

Week 2 I went 3-3 for a total of 5-7. Here are my Week 3 winners:
"Long Arms Alan", "Meme Team", "BooBoo SmithSchloopster", "Iron City Wet Dreams", "Titty Tickler", and "ZWFT".
