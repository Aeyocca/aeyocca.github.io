## Winless no more!
The last two winless teams got over the hump this week, avoiding the dreaded 0-3 start.

SaQuads (140pts) nabbed their first victory over Token Female (90pts) handily thanks to >60pts from the Kupp-Adams WR duo. It was fun while it lasted, as this duo was disbanded later in the week. Token Female had a tough one, as their highest scoring skill position player was OBJ with only 14pts. But hey, look on the bright side, their bench players outscored SaQuads by 0.7pts.

Seven Eleven (110pts) finally found the tight end advantage this week, and the week's lowest scoring team, against Iron City Wet Dreams (80pts). Seven Eleven's biggest advantage though came from Josh Allen's 5 TD (1 rushing) game against the WFT. Good thing they didn't gamble on Justin Fields' putrid debut (4.6pts) and left him on the bench. ICWD is in a tough spot injury-wise, with Cook, Michael Thomas, and now A.J. Brown injured on Sunday. It seems Cook will return next week for when ICWD plays me.. wonderful. I guess I should trade for Sam Darnold while I still can.

In a battle of the brothers, Meme Team (154pts) nabbed the W with the highest score of the week over Team Jeff (106pts). Two of the top 3 RBs this week in Zeke (26pts) and a 19 (!) target Najee (28pts) carried Meme Team. This matchup saw a 26 pt swing at the DST position with Team Jeff starting the worst available DST by 4 points in the WFT. Are they just objectively a bad defense at this point? Pretty wild for a team with seemingly so much talent. Fun fact, the difference was so great even in this 47 point blowout that if they swapped DSTs, Team Jeff would have won 132 - 127. Seems Team Jeff and his QB Jalen Hurts aren't going to look back on this game, flush it, and move forward.

BooBoo SmitchSchloopster (123pts) stands as the last undefeated team with a victory over Los Gatos (103pts). This was a rare near-perfect start sit decision week for SmithSchloopster with Singletary (4pts) over Michel (10pts) being the only error. Los Gatos had some tough injury luck as DeAndre Hopkins and McCaffery finished with a combined 11 points. Luckily for Los Gatos, James Robinson seems to have emerged as the lead back in Jacksonville as they lost the Chubba Hubbard sweepstakes and have Kenyan Drake as their only other RB.

Dimes Szn Danny Juice (127pts) wasn't very ticklish this week against Titty Tickler (115pts). Danny Juice had an incredibly consistent performance from their QB, starting RBs, and starting WRs with a standard deviation of only 1.6 pts across those five players. In contrast, Titty Tickler's core had a std dev of 7.8 pts. Titty Tickler must be disappointed in Kyle Pitts (5pts), but can't be upset with their start/sit decisions as no combination of players could have beat 127pts.
