# Keepin it even

Alan's back this week! Even if it is a day late. The league's parity is holding through 9 weeks as the best record is 6-3 and worst only 3-6. 4-5 can get you in the playoffs but only if you're as awesome as I am (.. and Steve I guess). Scores were relatively fair this week, as 6 of the top 5 scorers got the W. We're also still maintaining a <170pt gap in both PF and PA.

## Waiver-wire and trades

The offers report seemed busier than it was as BCLR kept with the strategy of stacking $1 pickups (9 total) in case they got outbid. The highest add of the week was the Titans DST to Seattle Krakens for only $5.

There was one trade before Sunday

## Bad Beats

Wide Tiddys Tied Biddys (153.08pts) completed the comeback against Alan's (still) Four-Win Weiners (151.22pts). The Weiners got an all-time performance from Joe Mixon (55.1) but unfortunately it was enough. Justin Fields (42.72) set the NFL record for QB rushing yards with 178 on the Weiners' bench, and Tom Brady's 55th career GWD in the final seconds dropped the Rams DST by a few points. Aaron Jones (6.5) also left early with an ankle injury. WTTB had a dud from D'Onta Foreman (4.1) but that was it. Recently acquired Tyler Lockett (17.7) outscored who they traded him away for (Pittman 5.2). Heading into Monday night, WTTB needed 9 points from the DST. Only problem is, their DST was on bye. The Saint DST was available on waivers, and the Ravens was on the roster of a player than had made zero (0, zip, zilch, nada) trades through 8 weeks. Naturally the best move was to take away the Saints DST to 100% clinch the victory. I ended up spending $21 FAAB to corner to market, not knowing this would drive WTTB .. man I'm done writing this I'm still mad and embarassed to have lost with Mixons 5 TDs. Steve won because I picked up the Saints who only scored 3pts, but the Ravens got just enough thanks to a batted INT in the 4th quareter. GG no re.

## Zero QB

Runnin Kupp That Hill (135.06pts) kept it rolling against Token Female (87.14pts). RKTH actually got double digits from their QB this week (Zach Wilson 10.56), while Token Female's QBs combined for 25.74pts (Rodgers and Herbert). It was a tough game from Rodgers who threw a trio of redzone INTs. RKTH had a trio of their own; the trio of Ekeler (24.1), Kupp (26.8), and Hill (27.3). Token Female were without their top two wideouts (Cooper & Chase), and couldn't decide which TE to start so they went with both Dawson Knox (5.5; TE22) and Mike Gesicki (1.3; TE47).

## Title Game

Red Solo Kupp (152.1pts) took the division lead against Team Tallman Kiss My A$$ (105.76pts) who is now on a league leading 3 game losing streak. RSK had good performances from Cordarrelle Patterson (18.3), Josh Allen (24.8), and Davante Adams (36.6). JuJu Smith-Shuster (18.8) as nabbed their third consecutive top 15 WR finish for RSK. The Tallman didn't get a great game from Khalil Herbert (2.3), nor recently acquired Michael Pittman Jr. (5.2). Geno Smith (20.8) did their part however continuing his impressive QB8 season. The Tallman is still in solid playoff position but a trio of down weeks has them second to last in points for (1092, compared to the league leading 1235.4).

## Underperformers

Broncos Country Let's Ride (117.62pts) snuck out a W against Hindsight Lad (108.34pts). Only 4 players in this matchup outscored projections. For Hindsight Lad, CEH (2.9) put up a 4th straight dud after a hot start. Mostert (8.6) conceeded much of their playing time to Jeff Wilson Jr. earlier in the season than expected. Also surprising was the Bengals scoring 42 points but their WR2 Boyd only scoring 9.4pts. BCLR meanwhile had a few decent games from T-Law (16.7), Jefferson (25.5), and Zach Ertz (15). Their DST (Dolphins) gave up 32 points, but scored on special teams to keep from going negative on the week. BCLR maintains their record tie with RKTH for the division lead but still lag >120 PF behind.

## Still in it

Seatle Krakens (129.9pts) avoided the dreaded 2-7 record this week against Jesus Christ Superstars (105.82pts). The Krakens had double digit performances from everyone except D'Andre Swift (8) and the Jags DST (4). The Superstars made the perfect start/sit decisions this week as everyone on the bench was either inactive or on the bye. They had a pair of nice waiver starters in Garrett Wilson (17.9) and Joshua Palmer (18.6). However the rest of the team was unimpressive as JCS barely cleared 100pts. The Krakens surprisingly scored within 0.4 points of their teams projections while JCS was within 1.32pts.
