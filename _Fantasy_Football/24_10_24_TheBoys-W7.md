# Livin on a prayer

We've made it halfway through the year with every team securing at least a pair of wins. 3-4 gets you into the playoffs with a 74 point spread across the last playoff team and last place in the league. Everyone's very much still alive in a week coming up without byes and 3 matchups between bottom 7 teams (3-4 or worse).

In NFL news, trades have been heating up. Amari Cooper goes to the Bills for a bag of chips, and D-Hop was traded to the Chiefs for last week's NYT crossword. Cooper Kupp is the center of recent trade talks as well as a spicy rumor for a Matt Stafford - Sam Darnold swap. Interestingly, that pair faces off Thursday night with Darnold likely walking away with the losing team. 

This week saw countless big fantasy games as all teams except two boasted at least one 20+ point game. Injuries of the week also might become a segment at this point. Chris Godwin suffered a likely season ending injury in garbage time on Monday while teammate Mike Evans tore his hamstring straight off the bone. Brandon Aiyuk put his new contract to good use after tearing his ACL as Deebo was taken to the hospital for pneumonia. In brighter injury news, we are finally free of Deshaun Watson. I was in Columbus, Ohio watching the Browns Bengals game on Sunday and saw him tear his achilles. I heard cheering from the mixed crowd and assumed it was from the Bengals fans until I heard them shout, "Now we actually have a chance!". The Browns offense this year has been historically bad, still yet to crack 20 points in a single game. Thats pretty reminiscent of the Kenny Pickett years in Pittsburgh but Pickett aint cost $240+ million. I heard someone mention this could be the last time Watson plays for the Browns. The salary cap isn't real, but I still have a hard time seeing on paper how the Browns avoid a $60+ million cap hit next year. Did teams not believe Joe Flacco still had it this offseason? It seems like not trying to sign him may have cost the Browns and the Dolphins their season.

# Matchups

120 in My Lambo (150.56) edged past Team Jeff (132.28). Team Jeff had a strong showing at running back with 5 total touchdowns across Bijan (23.3), KW3 (23.3), and Chubba (11.2). 120 imL tried to answer back with Joe Mixon's monster day (26.4), but both Jordan Mason (8.9) and Daniel Jones (5.96) failed to find the endzone. Tee Higgins (18.2) on Team Jeff outscored 120 imL's Ja'Marr Chase (17.6), something that I estimate happens at least 15% of the time in games they play together (2nd time this year). The story of this matchup was the trade multiple weeks ago with Chubba and Terry for AJ Brown and Brock Bowers. Coincidentally, Shultz was dropped from 120 imL's squad after acquiring Bowers and picked up by Team Jeff. Terry (15.8) saw a lot of volume from backup Marcus Mariota (more on that later), and Chubba appears to be a true workhorse on a putrid offense. Brock Bowers however was the gamble. Historically, rookie tight ends do not produce for fantasy, and Sam LaPorta was the TE1 as a rookie last year. Surely that can't happen again. Well Bowers is the first, second, and last read in the Raiders offense especially after the departure of Adams. After scoring 19.3 points Sunday, Bowers is on pace for 114 catches (4th in the NFL last year). Things were still tight heading into Monday night as 120 imL had Kyler and a slight lead against Mike Evans. Evans opened up with and early TD making me nervous, especially with a second dime to Evans in the endzone shortly after. However Evans hurt his hamstring so bad he couldn't pull in the second TD and left the game icing this matchup for 120 imL.

Pain Train (123.04) found their second win of the year against The Lesser Cody (112.08). TLC was off to a fiery start Thursday night as Javonte Williams (26.1) scored a pair of TDs in the route of the Saints. Kyren (19.6) contributed their own pair of TDs on Sunday, and Khalil Shakir (13.5) hauled in all 7 of their targets. What really hurt TLC in this game was Jayden Daniels (5.24) leaving the game with a rib injury very early against the Panthers. Fortunately, he ripped off a 50 yard run before leaving, but it wasn't enough against Pain Train. Pain Train was looking in rough shape Thursday as Cortland Sutton full goosed in a run first game script, and also had Deebo miss most of the game with an illness. The squad was hard carried however by DK Metcalf (19.9), Aaron Jones (20.6), and Josh Jacobs (20.2). Heading into Monday night, it was Zay Flowers and a 20 point lead for TLC against Pain Train's Lamar Jackson. Lamar is having himself and NFL MVP year and certainly a fantasy MVP year. Despite Derrick Henry running for >150 yards, all the TDs went to Lamar. TLC's hopes were at least dashed early as Zay hurt his ankle in the 2nd quarter and saw only one more target after that. Lamar's 5 TD passes tied a career high and put him at +225 for MVP (Mahomes 2nd with +475). Lamar may have just saved Pain Train's season

# Waivers and trades

Juan Jennings was a relatively hot waiver player coming off 4 TDs. The highest bid was $15 from Token Female, but 3 other teams were interested. 

We actually had trades this week!! Including the annual "Max trades his stars away" trade.
