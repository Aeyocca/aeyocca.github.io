# Happy Thanksgiving

Though I'm not going home for Thanksgiving, I will be calling home and sharing with my family that I'm thankful to play in a league with you fine people; especially The Steagles (1-10), Token Female (3-8), and Team Tallman (4-7). Cody? Not so much this week. Randy? Lets hope so after this week.

In a 10 team league, its hard not to approach parity. We have 7 teams within 3 games of each other with 3 weeks to play. 8 wins officially clinches playoffs. Congrats to Bills Bitch and our 4 7-4 teams who certainly can't possible lose 3 games in a row, right? Certainly not me who only plays 7-4 or better teams the rest of the way. That leaves 3 bubble teams in JCS, WTTB, and Team Tallman who are mathematically alive for a 1st round bye still.

## Matchups

The Underperformers (136.82) showed up this week against Alans Seven Win Weiners (118.36). The Weiners had a passable combination from the Tua (17.6) / Hill (30.6) stack, but the situation has grown desperate at RB. Keaton Mitchell (5.1) led the RB room with 33 yards on 8 carries. Rico Dowdle (4) did not take advantage of the stomping against Carolina, and despite trailing most of the game, Tyjae Spears saw only 2 catches and 4.6 fantasy points. RB was not as much of an issue for The Underperformers but it still wasn't a position of strength with Javonte (7.3) and Darrell Henderson Jr. (12.9). Their QBs finished 2nd (Purdy - 26.72) and 6th (Allen - 22.5) on the week and both WR 2s outscored their teammate (Puka - 18.7; DeVonta - 15.9). Even their bench overperformed with Love (20.88), Jaylen Warren (23.5), and Ridley (31.1) taking the week off. 

Time to throw a parade for the Steagles (133.84) who avoided infamy this week against Jesus Christ Superstars? (123.68). The Steagles scored their 2nd highest total of the season led by Tank Dell (28.9), Singletary (19.8), and DK Metcalf (20.4). They survived a season ending injury to Joe Burrow (8.74) and a dud from AJ Brown, but Brian Robinson (20.1) made up his receiving production with 7 catches for 58 yards. The Superstars saw a superstar performance finally from T-Law (32.18) and Saquon (30) finished #1 at their positions on the week. However, two key injuries to Kupp (2.1) and Kenneth Walker (2.6) sunk their chances of a victory. I'm not going to let The Steagles winning take away the joy of my fun facts: In their first official game vs. the Brooklyn Dodgers, the held their opponent to minus 33 rushing yards which currently is only the 3rd lowest rushing output in league history.

Bill's Bitch (162.5) continues to walk all over the league, doing so this week against Da Bearers (106.22). Da Bearers didn't stand much of a chance with a season ending injury to Mark Andrews (4.3) and a trio of duds from Henry (5.4), Garrett Wilson (0.9), and Aaron Jones (2.7). Joshua Dobb (16.94) put up a slightly better game than Pat Mahomes (16.88). Bill's Bitch had double digits from every single position. Raheem Mostert (10.3) and CeeDee (16.5) scored less than expected but Amon-Ra (21.7), Keenan Allen (27.6), and Kittle (22.9) more than made up the difference. Bill's Bitch continues to roster Minshew and Pickett but hasn't played a 2nd QB since week 7. The 3 times he has played a 2nd QB its been the wrong decision. Its a 4 WR league to Jeff who has 4 WR1s (Allen - 2; CeeDee - 3; ARSB - 6; Evans - 11).

Team Tallman Urgent Care (123.96) showed no mercy against Token Female (108.3). Token Female started two Jaguars who as a team scored 34 points and had the #1 fantasy QB on the week. That translated to just 15.8 combined points from Evan Engram and Etienne however. Davante Adams (21.2) had his best game since week 3, but Jakobi Meyers (8.9) cannot seem to sustain value. Tutu Atwell (2.7) caught only one of his three targets and Pacheco (10.1) struggled to find running room in the 2nd half. Tallman almost escaped the week without injury as Geno Smith (13.22) left the game late but returned for their final drive, reminiscent of when Ben "noodle arm" Roethlisberger thought they were still better than a healthy Landry Jones (iirc). Jared Goff (13.74) was having a stinker at home vs. the Bears but saved the day with a late TD to Jameson Williams and a last minute TD from Dmont (17.8). The Bills DST (21) had the pleasure of facing Zach Wilson (quite possibly for the last time) and helped keep Tallman's hopes alive.

Wide Titys Tied Biddies (127.42) snuck past Cody hates America (121.1) on Monday night. Rookie superstar CJ Stroud (15.34) tossed 3 interceptions but still racked up 336 yards for Cody hates America. Stefon Diggs (6.7) and Josh Jacobs (6.1) were duds but Brandon Aiyuk (26.6) scored from 76 yards out and Gibbs (21.5) maintained his steady dose of targets (6). WTTB saw a good game from Lamar (23.96) for the first time since week 7 and Mixon (21) produced enough points to be relevant before the Burrow injury. Heading into Monday night, the Biddies needed just over 9 points from Kelce for a win; a mark he failed to reach only once this year but it was in his last game. He cracked 9 points with a TD late in the first half and pulled both teams one game closer to 0.500.


## Trades and Waiver Wire

I'm looking to trade a QB for an RB. Hell even Tyreek is on the table at this point. I just want to feel something.

We have three teams with $0 FAAB left and another with $1.

## Sit Your Superstar

Last week's SYS was Sam Howell who had a terrible game and lost to the Tommy DeVito led Giants while throwing 3 killer interceptions and taking 4 sacks. Welp, this guy still rushed for 35 yards and a TD late saving the game and squeaking out 17.7 points finishing as the QB11.

This week's Sit Your Superstar is Javonte Williams. A tough matchup against the Browns DST and what will probably be the lowest over/under of the week. He could save the day with some receptions but I don't think the Broncos score any rushing TDs this week. Jaylen Warren should have a better game.


## Weekly predictions

We went 2-3 this week again for 29-26 overall. ESPN projections repeated 4-1 for 31-24. This week's winners are: Alan's Seven Win Weiners, Bill's Bitch, The Underperformers, Cody hates America, and WTTB
