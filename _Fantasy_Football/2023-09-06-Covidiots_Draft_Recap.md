Its #HopeSZN! The rosters are fresh, the records are equal, and the frustration meter is reset at zero. Its time to take a deep breath and prepare yourselves for another season of fantasy football. As a quick reminder, last year's champ Runnin Kupp that Hill zigged when others zagged in the draft, waiting until round 14 to grab their first and only QB (Mac Jones). However, they started their draft with the RB1 (Ekeler), 25 points-per-game Cooper Kupp through 9 weeks, RB16 (Kamara), WR2 (Hill), and WR19 (Higgins). Who were this year's big draft winners and losers? Of course, I have all the answers.

# Early Rounds
QBs dominated the first round this year with only 3 skill position players selected in round 1 (CMC, Ekeler, JJ). The next two QBs however fell to the end of the 3rd round. Red Solo Kupp waited the longest on their first QB taking a huge swing on Russ Wilson in the 5th

# Mid Rounds
Diontae Johnson was actually drafted ahead of George Pickens in this draft, contrary to popular Yinzer opinion. Along those same lines I'm surprised Jaylen Warren made it out of the 4th round, I mean yinz see dat little guy? Me neither, little bowlin bawl dahn er, cant stahp em. Anthony Richardson remained until the 8th round and has the upside to be the steal of the draft in my opinion.

# Late rounds
Shout out to Bill's B\*\*\*\* for taking their second RB in the 12th round (Samaje Perine). Almost taking zero RB literally. I predict their QB (Hurts) will outrush their second RB this year. Mac Jones went in the 14th for a second consective year, this year going to Bill's B\*\*\*\* to ride the bench, but maybe that's the true secret to winning a championship. Sophomore sensation Sam Howell was drafted in the 12th and there he shall remain doomed to irrelevance

# Week 1 predictions
We all know I'm pretty sharp with the projections here so sorry for spoiling #HopeSZN for those I predict to lose. I finished the year last year at 28-42 so maybe I should pick losers instead. Starting the fantasy season undefeated will be: Alan's Winless Weiners, Shave Less Pluck More, Token Female, cmac at #2, and Team Tallman
