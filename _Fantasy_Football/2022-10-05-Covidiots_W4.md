# 2-2

7 teams sit at 2-2, two are 3-1, and then there's Steve at 0-4. If Steve wins this week against Red Solo Kupp (2nd most PF so far), he's gauranteed to be only 1 game back from 7th place though.

## Waiver wire / trades

Waivers were pretty busy again, with 7 different players getting bids for a total of $37 combined FAAB. Hindsight Lad (DC Universe?) was the highest bidder for Mike Boone at $11 with no competing offers. Team Tallman preferred Latavius Murray for $5. Alan's Two-Win We-iners snaked another player from BCLR this time grabbing Gerald Everett for $5.

There was a single trade last week

## Fantasy football

Alan's Two-Win Weiners (131.54pts) fell short against Team Tallman Kiss My A$$ (135.36pts). This might have been emotionally the toughest fantasy football loss I've ever taken. Maybe it was the trash talking. Maybe the blown lead. Maybe I just had a rough week at work. After Deebo Samuel's 57 TD scamper, Deebo was 2.8pts shy with a whole half of football to play, and I near accepted defeat. But the second half dragged with Deebo getting a single catch for no yards and one minute in the 3rd. Then Samuel caught a redzone pass but was stood up at the goal line by Bobby Wagner. One tenth of a point shy. Hope. The 49ers are up, they don't need to pass, but they hand off to Samuel for 5 yards. Wait, a flag nullifies the play! Hope. Deebo has a single target/carry the rest of the game, going for 29 yards and a fantasy L for the Weiners. Hope was why this loss hurt so much and emotional investment in the game. As much as it sucked, my investment definitely makes the highs higher, and now a few days removed I realize its just a game so I'm over it. I'll see you again for revenge week 12 old man.

## No QB No Problems

Runnin Kupp That Hill (142.06pts) took down the Seattle Krakens (128.2pts). The Krakens were without their top two RBs effectively (JT 3.3pts, Swift O). The Krakens had a heroic effort from T.J. Hockenson who dropped the 7th highest scoring TE game in fantasy football history with 39.9pts. It wasn't enough though against RKTH despite not waking up early enough Sunday for the surprise Kamara inactive for the London game. RKTH got a combined 20.26pts from their QBs (Tanny and Mayfield). Their zero QB strategy works because they hit on 4 of their first 5 picks (Ekeler RB3, Kupp WR1, Hill WR3, and Higgins WR15). Shout out to them.

## No 1st rounder.. some problems

Wide Tiddys Tied Biddys (120.36pts) fell to 0-4 against Hindsight Lad (131.18pts). Hindsight lad finally got a Christian McCaffrey game (25.8pts) and a solid performance from DK Metcalf (21.9pts). WTTB draft strategy isn't playing out as well as RKTH. An injury to Dak Prescott (3rd), bad game from Stefon Diggs (3rd.. wait really? Good snag), underperformance from Conner and Aaron Jones (both 4th) didn't get the job done this week. Furthermore, Marcus Mariota completed only 7 passes for 3.86pts. But there's a lot of fantasy-e-ing left.

## Superstars week off

Jesus Christ Superstars (91.92) didn't show up against Red Solo Kupp (143.62pts). Mike Evans (30.3) and Saquon Barkley (18.2) were the only players to show up. Even super star Lamar was outscored by Jimmy G (13.86). JCS had a few decent performances on the bench though if you want something to be happy about. RSK somehow scored 143.62. Scanning their team, no player stuck out and Brady was the highest scorer at 25.4pts. However, five separate players scored over 19.5pts making this W a team effort.

## Lets Ride

Broncos Country came through again (163.84pts) to take down Token Female (125.34pts). Russ Wilson (27.48) had his best showing this week connecting with Courtland Sutton (16.2) for 5-52-1. Justin Jefferson (31) also decided to show up in London this week. Token Female despite a career game from Josh Jacobs (28-144-2 + 5 catches for 31yds; 34.5pts), got some duds from Christian Kirk (8.3), Dawson Knox (7, but not a dud for him), Amari Cooper (1.9), and Antonio Gibson (9.3). If you're going to dud, going against the week's highest scorer is a good time for it.

## Predictions

Last week I rebounded for 0-5 in predictions (equally as impressive as perfect picks I might add) for a total of 7-13. ESPN projections went 1-4 for a total of 6-14.
This week winners will be: "Alan's Two-Win Weiners", "Red Solo Kupp", "Runnin Kupp That Hill", "BCLR" (both teams will underscore projection), and "JCS"
