Welcome back to the fantasy season! Where dreams are crushed and hope is fleeting but everyone is as of today undefeated. I'm excited to share my journey to steal all of your money. The Boys Fantasy League made the jump to superflex this year, lets see how that affected the draft.

Only 7 QBs went in the first two rounds of the draft with the biggest run on QBs happening in the 4th (4 in a row, 5 total). Jeremy snaked me three times in a row with great values on both Zeke (bottom of the 5th), Hollywood Brown (bottom of the 7th), and Mac Jones (bottom of the 9th). I did not mouse slip in this draft and actually ended up with Chase Edmonds. I didn't pay attention to any of yall's drafts because the champion's team is all that matters.

The Zach White Football team (recently rebranded to the Zach White Commanders) looks to take command and keep their dominant run from last year going (finished 11-3). A trio of last place finishers at 4-10 (Long Arms Alan, Inverted PPs, and Token Female) can forget last year, but so far this year they are winless.

Im going to try and make more successful picks than last year as I finished 20-28.

This year's undefeated teams through one week will be: "Long Arms Alan", "Team Jeff", "Los Gatos", "Titty Tickler", "Afghanistan Feminists", and "Meme Team".
