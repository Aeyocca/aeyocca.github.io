# Inter-division time!!

This was our first week of cross-division matchups. The "Bad" division snagged 3 of the 5 matchups with Team Tallman being the only disappointment scoring a league-worst 70.38 points. 5 teams sit at 4-2 or better and are well poised nearing the halfway point of the season. The Steagle's rough 0-6 record has ESPN projecting them for a 3% playoff probability. Don't tune out Shea, it can be just a fun to play spoiler! Speaking of inter-division matchpus, lets talk inter-conference NFL games there were 7 such matchups in the NFL this week. The AFC went 6-1 on such matchups as the Chargers were the only losers (color me shocked if Staley keeps his job after this year). Some NFL teams are already starting rumors about trading away players to build for future years. As a redraft league we don't have that option and need to keep fighting each week until the playoff probability hits 0.


# Matchups

Alan's Four-Win Weiners (137.7) bought Team Tallman Kiss My A$$ (70.38) into the retirement a week in the retirement home this weekend with a dominant victory. It was a matchup riddled with injuries. A total of six players in this matchup left their games dues to injury. The Weiners had two return however (Hill - cramps; Stevenson - potential concussion). Heading into the week, Tallman wasn't afraid of the Tua-Hill stack, but he should have been as they combined for 50.78 points including another deep peace sign TD for Hill. The Weiners also continue to benefit from WR3 overall waiver pickup Adam Thielen and his 28.5 garbage time points. Tallman saw only three double digit performances (CMC, Ekeler, Stafford) and none above 15 in a week to forget, and he must forget quickly at 2-4.

Wide TitiesTied Biddies (138.0) is heating up, sending The Steagles (122.3) to 0-6. WTTB said "screw dem runningbacks" this week as their two starters failed to crack 10 points (James Cook - 7.1; Joe Mixon - 9.2). The rest of the squad, however, showed up big as only Lamar underscored their projection (17.12). WTTB won this week by their TE advantage with Kelce (21.4) crushing Cole Kmet (2.9). The Steagles put up their highest score of the year and it was only good for the 6th best score of the week. Its really a wonder given their roster which looks formitable, sporting 3 top 15 RBs (Kyren/Bijan/Robinson Jr.) and a top 10 WR (AJ Brown). The Joe Burrow (13.8) injured calf has really screwed the first portion of the season, but if you start winless, you can finish lossless.

Bills Bitch (158.9) secured the auto W as the week's highest scorer against Token Female (136.18). So far the draft pick of the year has been Raheem Mostert (34.2 / RB2 overall) taken by Jeff in the 13th round. Jeff started Amon-Rawesome (30.4) in leiu of a 2nd quarterback to great success. He even left Breece Hall (20.3) chilling on the bench. Token Female had a respectable week, good for 4th highest, but it wasn't enough. Also opting to sit a 2nd quarterback, it didn't work so well for Token Female since Jakobi Meyers (17.1) and Davante Adams (4.9) swapped jerseys on Sunday. Regardless, starting 2 WRs for a team with 260 passing yards and 1 passing TD probably doesn't work unless you've started the Rams. The most worrying disappointment on the squad was DeAndre Hopkins (3) who got nothing going when Tannehill was injured. Its so worrying since the Tannehill injury appears long term which limits the Titans offense moving forward (*cough*, trade me Henry in dynasty, *cough*). This was a tough loss given last week (143 to 159), but its a good sign to be scoring high.

Jesus Christ Superstars (132.88) benefitted from playing the Underperformers (82.46). The Underperformers were true to form without a single player cracking their projection. In fact, only two players broke double digits (Josh Allen - 13.86; Pollard - 17). No one on the bench broke 10 points either. If you're going to have a down week, I guess its nice to get them all out of the way at once. JCS finally had Saquon (13.8) back in the lineup and continues to get consistent production from $48 waiver pickup D'Andre Swift. Watchout for the Superstars moving forward who can afford to wait for De'Von Achane to return sitting at 4-2. Meanwhile the Underperformers have the best record in the league (5-1) despite sitting 7th best in points for.

Red Solo Kupp (114.26) snuck out a win against Da Bearers (103.48). Both teams had a set of mediocre performances highlighted by Gabe Davis (3.1), Russell Wilson (6.9), and Mahomes (17.34; mediocre for him QB7 on the week). This matchup mostly came down to Da Bearer's big brain decision of sitting Garrett Wilson (17). Now, sitting a WR whose QB is Zach Wilson isn't much to make fun of, but the Eagles were likely a pass-funnel defense; 24th best against WRs entering the week and down 2 starting DBs before the game and losing 2 more during the game. Gabe "the babe" Davis coming into the week was riding 4 consecutive games with a TD but came crashing down this week, catching only 3 passes including a fumble.

## Trades and Waiver Wire

We have some trades!!

|-----------------+--------------|
|WTTB | JCS |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|
| Receives Jaylen Waddle | Receieves Cooper Kupp |
| Receives Dak Prescott | Receieves Sam Howell |
| Receives Joe Mixon | Receieves De'Von Achane |
|-----------------+--------------|

|-----------------+--------------|
|Team Tallman | JCS |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|
| Receives Hollywood Brown | Receieves Joe Mixon |
|-----------------+--------------|


Waivers were pretty weak as not a single player received multiple bids. Therefore, a total of $51 was wasted with the most embarassing being $11 on Julio "one trick" Jones who I seriously doubt sees a start. Thats like spending $21 on some loser like Emari Demercado. Wild.

## Sit Your Superstar (new segment!)

I'm going to call my shot (an often be wrong) each week on a player where traditional wisdom won't let you but I can opine on my own that they'll perform worse than their replacement. I'm inspired by thinking Dmont was a sit last week (yeah yeah he got injured but the Bucs matchup was terrible and he wasn't doing great at first anyway). 

This week's Sit Your Superstar is Prime Time Kirk Cousins (QB8) who should be sat for Geno Smith (QB23). This one I think is a bit easier to do since Cousins is facing the 49ers who are 3rd best against QBs and Cousins has been bad in 2 of his last 3 games, also being without Justin Jefferson. I promise these will get spicier though.

## Weekly predictions

We went 4-1 this week for 16-14 overall and Steve went 3-2 (only diff is I picked Jeff over Em). Steve I'd sit tight there; 60% will likely take the crown. ESPN projections  went 3-2 15-15. This week's winners are: Alan's Two Win Weiners, Bills Bitch (but Waddle is scary), Token Female, Team Tallman
