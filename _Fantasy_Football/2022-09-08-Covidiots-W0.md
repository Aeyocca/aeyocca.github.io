It's been a long offseason for the Covidiot Football League. To quickly recap last season, parity was rampant as the two regular season champs finished 9-5, 7 others were 6-8 or better, and Brian's QB-depleted squad finished 2-12. Team Tallman Kiss My A$$ edged out Still the Gr8st Show on Paper by 6 points thanks to a 35pt game from Hard Knocks darling Amon-Ra St. Brown to take home the championship.

But its a fresh year which means a fresh start and everyone is winless.

## Quick draft recap

10 Quarterbacks went in the first two rounds with Wide Tiddys Tied Biddys and Trapped in autodraft hell the only teams leaving the first two rounds without a quarterback. In fact, Steve's team left without either of their first two picks, loading up in rounds 3-6 and garnering the #1 spot in ESPN's final standings ranking.

Brian eventually snagged Mac Jones in the 14th  and traded their 6th round pick (DJ Moore) for Steve's 16th round pick (Baker Mayfield). Lets hope this year goes better for Brian.

Alan's Winless Weiners went for the zero-RB strategy taking a single RB in the first 12 rounds (Javonte Williams). They may have tried to draft Chase Edmonds in the 9th, but the fantasy Gods decided Zach Ertz must have been the better play there. 

Good luck to Red Solo Kupp taking on the reigning champ, and congrats to Cody for the free win against anti-QB Brian this week.

Lets try these predictions again, last year I didn't do much better than the ESPN projections. In fact I did notably worse
