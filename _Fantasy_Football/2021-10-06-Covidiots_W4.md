## Pop a bottle for the '72 Dolphins

The last undefeated teams fell this week, one in spectacular fashion

Lets start with the toilet bowl, as Team Tallman Kiss My A$$ (95pts) fell to Alan's Winning Weiners (99.92pts). It was a clash of superior fantasy defenses as neither team could get going. Team Tallman managed to snipe Jimmy G's calf midgame as he left with 8pts. The Weiners manufactured a faulty injury report stating Dalvin (6.4pts) was healthy when he clearly wasn't. Team Tallman stubbornly refuses to pivot from position rank 60 Allen Robinson and The Weiners continue to flub the flex position, scoring 3.6, 4.6, 2.8, and 2.4 points at that position so far this year. Come on guys, trade me a receiver. I'm sure we're all glad Tallman has a loss, but lets appreciate how they have over 100 less points against than the next less in only 4 weeks!

Red Solo Kupp (168pts) took down the other unbeaten team How Do I Butt Stuffed? (128pts). Kupp had a major 30pt advantage at the QB and DST positions, but still would have won without that cushion. Only two of Kupp's players underscored their projection, and one was Matt Stafford that missed it by only 0.1 points. Meanwhile, Butt Stuffed only had three players outscore their projections; Derrick Henry, CEH, and Scarry Terry. Thank to Bridgewater's concussion, Butt Stuffed now has two injured QBs on the bench along side Cordarrelle Patterson (position rank 3).

In a husband vs. wife matchup, Eating the Ws Until the Ls (148pts) ***beat their wife*** Token Female (121pts). They both sit at 2-2 in the same division, but Eating the Ws Until the Ls is ahead because they are a man. Bold decision by Eating the Ws to start Ben Roethlisberger (9pts, 6 from one play), but they were bailed out by Tyreek Hill's monster performance ([ironic](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/tyreek-hill-domestic-violence-child-abuse-investigation/neqfn40200lt16ik2142ay772)). 


# Trade recap / Waiver Wire

There were no trades this week. Come on guys my WRs suck, hit me with a counter please.

Half the league tried to grab Chubba Hubbard with THPF being awarded him. I guess he deserves it after this week.
Cole Beasly had three teams claim him, and Alan's Winning Weiners was awarded him. Unfortunately, this means my team now needs to go back to masking while in our facilities and listen to the ignorant nonsense from a priveleged child.

## Predictions update
For every matchup this season, I will pick a winner and keep track of ESPN's projected winner. ESPN's projected winner will be updated after the week in case of last minute substitutions, but I will make my picks based on starting roster each Wednesday.

Week 3 I went 4-1 for a total of 9-6. I'd feel better about it if I wasn't the one that lost. ESPN projections went 3-2 for a total of 8-7. Here are my Week 4 winners:
"Alan's Wining Weiners", "Eating the Ws Until the Ls", "How Do I Butt Stuffed?", "Tony Hawks Pro Facemasking" (he has to win eventually, right?), and "Still the G8st Show On Paper"
