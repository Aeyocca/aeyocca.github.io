# They are who we thought they were

Week 5 saw its first true shootouts of the year to couple with several breakout WR performances. 7 WRs scored more than 25 points compared to 5 QBs exceeding that mark. High end RB scoring suffered from the WR bump this week. Only 2 RBs cracked 20 points (Tank Bigsby / Swift).

I'm having more and more trouble with inspiration for introductions. Its devolved into rambling at this point (maybe it always has been?). I've decided to try a few weeks with a combined article for both leagues. The matchups feature the same studs/duds so to keep it fresh, I'm just going to highlight some start/sit decisions I think were particularly brave or impactful. James and Shea are literally the only ones in Cody's league not also in this one and I'm not sure they even read this when I write them. I'll throw the standings in a table at then end for a quick view of both leagues for those curious.

The hot news in the NFL this week are landing spots for Davante Adams, the Jet's firing Robert Saleh, and Drake Maye making his first NFL start. The Adams contract I believe is what has slowed trade progress. Adams' cap hit and salary in 2024 is manageable, ~$25 million the Raiders could eat to facilitate a deal. The next two years, however, stipulate $35 million in base salary and a cap hit of $44.1 million; higher than CeeDee and JJ. Of course he would agree to a restructure with whatever team to move on, and the salary cap isn't real. However, generating and agreeing to a restructure takes time and slows trade talks.

I sternly disagree with Woody Johnson's decision to fire Robert Saleh. There's been a single team in NFL history that fired a head coach during the season and made the playoffs that same year; the 2021 Raiders who moved on from Jon Gruden due to off the field conduct ([this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Gruden#Email_controversy_and_resignation) is always worth a re-read). This to me is another egotistical billionaire fearful of his own fading mortality too impatient to make a rational decision. Is Saleh a good head coach? Maybe not, but an early season swap at head coach won't fix you're team's issues. They've lost to the 49ers, the Broncos in a bad weather game, and the undefeated Vikings. The rest of the year is relatively soft, but it all hinges on the play of Aaron Rodgers, as expected and as nearly every NFL team goes.

Jacoby Brissett has done a great service to the Patriots franchise. Brissett has started the first 5 games for the Pats to give Drake Maye time to develop. More importantly, Brissett has taken 17 sacks and many more hits. Sitting at 1=4, I'm surprised they aren't waiting longer before putting the rookie in. Its a lost year already, and 3 of their next four games are against the Jets, Titans, and Bears; all formidable defenses. Often a QB switch occurs to save coach's jobs, but this is the first year for head coach Jerod Mayo, and I'd be shocked if he was in any sort of danger. Brissett hasn't had a passer rating above 40 the last 4 games, so maybe some restlessness from the player's drove the decision.

# The Boys Matchups

120 in My Lambo (199.58) decimated Mr. Big Chests (95.76). The week started hot for 120 iML with a 33.4 point game from Drake London during the Falcons' shootout victory over the Bucs. Topping that performance, Ja'Marr Chase (41.3) demonstrated why he's considered and elite WR after a slow start with a pair of long TDs against the Ravens. The only other player required to overcome MBC was recently acquired Brock Bowers (23.7) who opened the game with a 50+ yard TD. MBC had a slither of hope after Thursday night with Baker Mayfield (23.4) and Godwin (11.6) not having terrible games, but were certainly disappointing given the final score of the game. Sunday morning in London, however, Sam Darnold (5.26) came back to Earth after a hot start, and Breece Hall (6.7) was erased partly thanks to a trio of interceptions from Aaron Rodgers. After Ja'Marr's big game, this matchup was well out of hand. Things couldn't possibly go wrong for 120 iML this week. A surprise inactive of Joe Mixon announced on Friday left them with the decision between Trey Sermon (18.3; RB5 on the week) or Tank Bigsby (25.9; RB1 on the week). The only thing that truly went wrong was being unable to officially crack the 200 point mark. Regardless, this week should help a lot come playoff tiebreaker time.

Taylor's team (154) destroyed The Bear (108.36). The Bear saw their namesake's best combined score of DJ Moore (27.5) and Caleb Williams (23.56) so far this year against the Panthers who seem to be past their QB replacement bump (told you it was real). A pair of bye weeks for starting RBs DMont/JK Dobbins led to the Emanuel Wilson (2.5) start. To be fair, heading into the week, people believed his snap count would rise, but Wilson was on the field for only 15 snaps Sunday. The only other players to crack their projections were the Steelers DST (9) and Derek Carr (13.6) leading to a disappointing week for The Bear. Taylor's team was carried by the trio of Kirk Cousins (35.36), Garrett Wilson (29.1, and Tucker Kraft (24.8). Cousins passed for over 500 yards on Thursday in what is hopefully a preview of things to come as an Atlantian and Cousins dynasty owner. Garrett Wilson was hyper targetted by Aaron Rodgers in London (22 targets!), yet couldn't quite carry the Jets to a victory. Tucker Kraft accomplished the rare feat of repeating a good game as a TE, now with 3 TDs and 14 targets in the last two games. Next up for Kraft is a matchup against the Cardinals who are also historically weak against TEs. The only concern for Taylor's team this week I'd say is Rachaad White (9.6) who in a shootout had 3 catches for -6 yards and no TDs. I'm not concerned for MHJ (5.6) who is still the WR18 on the year and has plenty of time to improve. The expectations for him were too damn high.

Token Female (146.3) prevailed against Team Jeff (127.86). You wouldn't know it by their records (combined 2-8), but this was the second highest scoring matchup of the week. Every player from Token Female cracked double digits including the first good game from Brandon Aiyuk (22.7). Etienne (12) supposedly suffered a shoulder injury leading to a minority of snaps played but still managed double digits thanks to 6 catches. Stefon Diggs (14.2) didn't see a huge uptick in performance after the Collins injury exit but has been Mr. Consistent so far this year at WR8. Team Jeff deserves to lose after starting Deshaun Watson (8.4) who I hope loses his starting job to Jameis Winston soon. Mike Evans (23.2) benefitted from the Thursday night shootout in Atlanta and Chubba Hubbard (17.5) has been one of the only workhorse backs in the league this year. Jeff's bench though was crawling with points including Tee Higgins (29.3), Rhamondre Stevenson who was ceremoniously benched (19.2), and Keom Coleman (11.9, still better than Watson). Team Jeff still scraped together enough points for 5th most on the week, but were unfortunately pitted against #4.

The Lesser Cody (161.5) doubled up Hamas Rockets (79.6). Nothing went right for the Rockets this week. Josh Allen (14.64) actually had an impressive scoreline considering he was concussed early in the game (speculation), and went on to complete just 9 of 30 passes. Not sure if Hamas Rockets just isn't paying attention, or really doesn't want to let go of Evan Engram (0) who hasn't played a game since week 2, and Davante Adams (0) who is sitting out with a "hamstring" issue. Not like this matchup would have been close anyway since TLC dominated with a combined 55+ points at the QB position (Daniels / Burrow). Zack Moss (8.2) was injured early in the game, but Zay Flowers (19) racked up catches on the other side of the Bengals Ravens Shootout.  Nico Collins (15.8) also left with a hamstring injury but not after a long bomb TD. Travis Kelce (16) seems to have reprised his role in the offense since the departure of Rashee Rice as well.

Pain Train (106.82) squeaked out a victory this week against Good on Paper (105.7). GoP suffered from Bye-pocalypse with Gibbs, Pollard, ARSB, and Hurts on bye. In their stead, however, were some solid games especially from the immortal Joe Flacco (26.56). I heard this week Flacco preferred to sign with the Dolphins, but weren't interested. Can you imagine? Kareem Hunt (18.7), fellow immortal, has retaken over the Cheifs backfield with 27 carries Monday night. Also for GoP, Brian Robinson Jr. (13.8) started losing more and more work to Austin Ekeler, yet maintained the goaline role with a pair of TDs. Pain Train has more of an injury problem (Tua / Puka) than a bye week issue (Goff), but QB1 Lamar Jackson (33.42) continues to carry his squad, even if this was their first victory. Josh Jacobs (16.4) had a decent afternoon and the Bears DST (17) feasted against GoP's Andy Dalton (4.74). The Dalton / Bears matchup certainly decided this one with an interception at the start of the second half, and a move to Bryce Young for the final drive where Young scored 3.12 points.

ZWC (107.84) walked to 5-0 against Team Tendonitis (92.5). TT's had a rough go starting with the CMC injury and Saquon/Nabers bye weeks. Ty Chandler (5.9) had a surprising opportunity after Aaron Jones was injured yet didn't do much with it and Carson Steele (1.2) is starting to look like the undrafted free agent he is. Rashid Shaheed (18.6) yet again split the safeties for a bomb TD, yet Diontae Johnson (5.9) no longer benefitted from the "QB-switch bump". ZWC had their own bye/injury woes with AR, JT, Brandin Cooks, and Herbert out this week. This led ZWC to start Tyler Conklin (11.5) in the superflex spot who still scored more than Watson. Rico Dowdle (19.4) had what everyone is calling a "breakout" game but I don't think he looked special Sunday night (or Monday morning). Wan'Dale (16) also had a decent game with Nabers compensating for a down game from CeeDee (11.4). Not many points were required to pull ahead of TT this week and there were plenty from CJ Stroud (16.94) and King Henry (16.6) to slide ZWC to 5-0.

# Covidiots highlights

This is a 3 WR and double Flex league at 8 teams so there are also way too many players to comment on / analyze. 

The tightest matchup of the week was The Steagles (Shea; 140.74) against Amon Ra Dog (James; 144.48). The Steagles had bye/injury-pocalypse (Hurts, Barkley, Adams, Puka) but did snag Trey Sermon (18.3) off waivers and have been rolling with Mooney (31.5). Sitting Bowers (23.7) for Kincaid (5.4) really cost them this week with mediocre games across the board for ARD outside of DJ Moore (27.5); the next highest scorer was Jayden Daniels (19.72). Shoutout to Im So Broken (Cody) for scoring the 2nd most points on the week with their entire bench combining for 0 points (hence the name). Luckily for them they faced Steve who scored the most points on the week (204.24)


# Trades / Waiver Wire
In Covidiots, we have Watson and Pitts chilling on waivers, that just brings me a bit of joy. In The Boys, Drake Maye only garnered 3 bids totaling $23 and going to The Lesser Cody for $12.
