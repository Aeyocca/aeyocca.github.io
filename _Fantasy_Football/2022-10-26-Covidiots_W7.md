# Separation at the half way mark

We're starting to separate a bit with 6 playoff teams at 4-3 or better and the bottom four at 3-4 or worse. The points for spread is still with 100 points from top to bottom through seven weeks however. We're only halfway through the regular season though and even Steve and Jeff at 2-5 have a >15% shot at the playoffs.

## Waiver wire / trades

The Gus Bus was the highest FAAB getter of the week going to JCS for $27. BCLR meanwhile had a fire sale, swapping out four of their players for waiver adds.

There two trades this week

## TDs vs. Injuries

Alan's Four-Win Weiners (148.16pts) outscored Hindsight Lad (129.52pts) in what was almost a shootout. The Weiners started four RBs in this one after trading for Mixon plus Aaron Jones. Those four RBs combined for over 300 yards and 6 TDs. Hindisght lad matched the high scoring with big performances from Mahomes (26.92), the Dallas DST (19) and Raheem Mostert (20.3). However, DK Metcalf (2.2) left early in the game and Damien Harris (2) seemed to not be fully recovered from their previous injury. I'm a little surprised Hindsight lad started Damien after picking up Chuba Hubbard (15.3), but it didn't affect the outcome in this one.

## Down goes Tallman (?)

Team Tallman (99.16pts) looked the other way against Runnin Kupp That Hill (149.18pts). In his own words, "I don't give a shit if I lose". Well when you get smacked by Brian I guess its best to ignore your problems. I might be taking that advice next week. The day started rough for the Tallman with Amon-Ra St. Brown (1.4) leaving the game early with a concussion and it didn't get much better. Not a single player outscored their projections. Meanwhile, RKTH kept it rolling even without Cooper Kupp and only 3.88pts from their only started QB (Tannehill) thanks to Austin Ekeler's (36.7) fantasy garbage time extravaganza.

## Back2Back

Wide Tiddys Tied Biddys (102.58pts) lucked out against Jesus Christ Superstars (97.72pts) for their second W of the year. It was a crawl to the finish for both teams. JCS got decent games from Mike Evans (18.6) and Jimmy G (16.32), but mostly duds from the rest of the team. The most surprising dud was Mark Andrews (0.4) who had zero targets but did get a carry. In this close game JCS had Jacobi Meyers (11.4) but was against him in the other league. He needed > 16 but < 26 from Meyers.  An early TD was promising for the sweet spot but the Pats got blown out quickly by the Bears. At least JCS got the W in the other league. WTTB suffered through another Kyle Pitts start (3.9) but were carried to victory on the back of Kenneth Walker III (28.8)

## Shootout

Token Female (157.28pts) dominated against Seattle Krakens (142.08pts) in the 3rd highest scoring matchup of the year to date. Token Female had huge games from Josh Jacobs (36.5) and Ja'Marr Chase (33). With Dawson Knox on the bye, Token Female chased the points from Mike Gesicki's ~25pt week 6. However he was cursed by Token Female to a 5.7pt performance, good for TE25 on the week. The Kraken's Joe Burrow (39.24) and Travis Etienne (18.9) tried their best for the team. No player was super disappointing for the Kraken besides the Jags DST (-2) but sometimes you just play the week's highest scoring team.

## Toilet Bowl

Red Solo Kupp (100.32pts) did just enough against Broncos Country Lets Ride (86.58pts). The zero QB strategy came out ahead again in this matchup as RSK had a combined 1.52pts from QB (Goff) and superflex (Corey Davis) compared to BCLR's 36.78pts (T-Law + Davis Mills). RSK also started both Nick Chubb (18.7) and Kareem Hunt (7.8), but benefited from a classic Mahomesian performance to JuJu (25.4). BCLR had their top 2 WRs on bye (JJ + AJ Brown) and replaced them with the duo of Courtland Sutton (5.3) and Alec Pierce (6.7). With Russ Wilson out due to a hamstring injury, T-Law (18.7) was their highest scoring player.

## Predictions

Last week I went 2-3 again in predictions for a total of 14-21. ESPN projections went 0-5 for a total of 13-22 marking the first time I'm ahead of ESPN projections since starting this column I believe.
This week winners will be: "Alan's Two-Win Weiners", "Team Tallman Kiss My A$$", "Jesus Christ Superstars", "Seattle Krakens", and "Red Solo Kupp"
