## The right backup

Long Arms Alan (151.36pts) survived Russia Invaders' seige (142.72pts). The day started in London with LAA coming out almost 30pts ahead thanks to Alexander Mattison and Justin Jefferson snaking redzone touchdowns from the Invaders' Dalvin Cook (10.6pts). The Invaders fought back all day since though, falling down almost 50 total points before the late window. The Invaders' trio of Murray, Hollywood, and Ertz combined for 61.38pts putting them ~39pts behind with only Mike Evans to play on Sunday night. The Buccaneers fell down early to the Chiefs creating a passing script for Brady and Evans. The Bucs had -3 total rushing yards in the first half and at one point ran 28 consecutive passing plays. Furthermore, the Chiefs were man to man covering Evans with a rookie, allowing him to rack up about 25 points halfway through the third quarter. Luckily for LAA, the Chiefs adjusted their coverage and Evans finished with 30.3pts, just shy of the win. GG.

## Harvey Two-Face

BooBoo SmithShloopster (pts) defeated Token Female (124.38pts). Both teams had a Harvey Face and a Scary Face ([reference here](https://youtu.be/MTLp14MKDDU?t=148)). The Harvey Face of Token Female's (5 players) roster averaged ~20.5pts while the Scary Face (4 players) averaged 5.39pts including Dawson Knox as the TE on the week. BooBoo had more Harvey Face players (6) than Scary Face (3) averaging and 7.16pts respectively leading them to victory this week. Heading into Sunday night, BooBoo needed ~9pts from Deebo and Kupp combined to win. That mark came 

## 7's unlucky

Los Gatos Kitties (133.14pts) fell short against Team Jeff (140.5pts). Los Gatos Kitties' unlucky number was 7 and 5 of their players score N.7 points (Henry 23.7, Conner 10.7, Cooks 18.7, Olave 16.7, and London 3.7). London was the only huge disappointment for the Kitties, however they must be upset leaving 29.6pt Miles Sanders on the bench. Team Jeff was carried to their first win by TJ Hockenson (39.9pts) which might be the best game from a TE of the year and another strong TE performance on the bench (Mo Alie-Cox 26.5pts). Team Jeff also survived another dud by #2 overall pick JT (3.3pts)

## Predictions

I went 4-2 on game picks last week for 8-10 overall. ESPN projections repeated 4-2 for the third straight week. This week's winners are: "Long Arms Alan", "Token Female", "Zach White Commanders", "Los Gatos", "The Tagovailorian", and "MBC" (someone has to win)
