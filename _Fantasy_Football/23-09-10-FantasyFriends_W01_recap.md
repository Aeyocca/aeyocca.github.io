# We were right about some things

As I mentioned earlier, the draft community is getting sharper: ADP is more closesly resembling fantasy finishes. Lets confirm our biases with some week 1 examples (ADP : position rank). Austin Ekeler (RB2 : RB2), CMC (RB1 : RB3), Rhamondre Stevenson (RB12 : RB13). Stefon Diggs (WR4 : WR4), Chris Olave (WR12 : WR10). Cherry picked for sure but a fun coincidence nonetheless. Lets get to the matchups!

## Matchups

Winless no more! Alan's Winless Weiners (147.88) put up the top score of the week, dooming The Steagles (108.88) to an opening loss. The Weiner's were carried by a Tua (27.14) to Freak (44.5) stack accounting for >48% of their total fantasy points. A trio of disappointments from Akers (8.9pts, 1.3 yards per carry), Dameon Pierce (6.7), and Goedert (goose) weren't an issue thanks to the Fins. The Steagles are off to a rough start with Joe Burrow earning $86,477,987 per fantasy point. The rest of the squad held up however as no other player fell below more than 4 points of their projected total.

Daaaaaaaaa Bearers (132.1) squashed Shave Less, Pluck More (SLPM; 83.84) with the biggest stomp of the week. Heading into the week, Da Bearers boasted confidence in starting a defense against their QB2 assuring they would combine for at least 30 points. Passing TDs for Daniel Jones (4.46) were worth 6 points on Sunday as the lone TD pass went right to Da Bearers' defense (Cowboys; 35) in what will likely be the highest weekly score by a defense all year. SLPM's top two draft picks combined for a paltry 9/20th of a Cowboys defense (Lamar - 6.56; Barkley - 9.3). Their two bench QBs (Sam Howell - 15.18; Richardson - 20.92) both outscored the starters, though it didn't make a difference in this one.

Red Solo Kupp (RSK; 128.54) was top heavy in their victory against Token Female (90.72). JJ (24), Diggs (26.2), and Watson (20.66) led the way for RSK. Jefferson pickup up where he left off last year. His production is so expected that his IBM Watson "Boom" projection line is set at 32.6pts, compared to 25.5 for CMC, 27.3 for Mahomes, and 29.8 for Jalen Hurts. Token Female's bigger concern than a week 1 loss is the loss of Aaron Rodgers who tore his achilles only 4 snaps into his Jets tenure. Will Token Female turn to Ryan Tannehill after his 2.42 point opener, run with the 1 QB strategy in a superflex, or make a run at one of the 2 starting QBs on the waiver wire (Zach Wilson/Josh Dobbs)?

Bill's B\*\*\*\* (Jeff; 122.18) was Cody's B\*\*\*\* (124.74) this week (get ready I'm probably going to use that all year when Jeff loses). Jeff was off to a rough start as the Eagles struggled to move the ball against the Pats leaving Jalen Hurts with 12.5 points. Cody's QB (Josh Allen) fared worse against a stout Jet's defense producing 4 turnovers and only 9.04 points. Jeff's bench however balled out which you hate to see in such a tight matchup. 10 different start/sit decisions could have brought the W home for Jeff. The future is bright though as their zero RB strategy seems to pay off immediately with an electric performance from Breece Hall (15.7) and double digits from both starters (Samaje Perine - 11.8; Raheem Mostert - 13). Cody's early investment in RBs paid off, as he started the RB5 (Pollard), RB10 (Chubb), and RB16 (Mattison).

Jesus Christ Superstars? (104.76) nabbed the first toilet bowl victory of the year against Team Tallman Kiss My A$$ (101.18). Tallman didn't even wait for opening kickoff before pouring on the excuses. Travis Kelce and Christian Watson were late injuries and were replaced by Zach Ertz (8.1) and Zach Charbonnet (1.1). In our 12 team league, there is a team that has Kelce and Watson, but they found a way to score 130.98, so try and find a better excuse. Tyler Lockett (3) also left Sunday's game early with an injury. However they only fell 3 points short of the win against the Superstars who now undefeated should remove the question mark. The beastly squad were carried by star QB Dak Prescott (6.32), and leading WR duo George Pickens (8.6) and Ja'Marr Chase (9.1). Austin Ekeler (26.4) did as much as they could as the backup to all-pro caliber Najee Harris (5.3) in this week's winning effort. I fear for SLPM who takes on the Superstars next week.

## Trades and Waiver Wire

No trades yet!? Lets fix that next week.

The waiver wire went crazy this week. A total of 33 waiver claims were submitted totaling $345 in bids. Puka Nacua was the most valuable player with $138 bid going to Am I good? for $82. What an overspend, who would pay that much for that guy? Token Female rushed to replace Aaron Rodgers with Zach Wilson for $15. Team Tallman wins bid of the week edging out other bidders by $1 for RB4 Tyler Allgeier at $21.

## Weekly predictions

Welp, here we are at 2-3 to start the year. That's disappointing enough, but ESPN projections started off 5-0. Like half of the league, I have some catching up to do. Maybe I should update these predictions Sunday morning instead of calling my shot on Wednesday... Anyway this week's winners are: Alan's One Win Weiners, The Steagles, Bill's B\*\*\*\*, JCS, and Red Solo Kupp
