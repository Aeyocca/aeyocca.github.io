#I Was Wrong

Everyone is afraid to be wrong. Being wrong hurts. It sucks. It shouldn't.

Some common phrases spawned by this aversion:
- "Sorry if this is wrong"
- "Correct me if I am wrong"
- "This is probably wrong"
- "This could totally be wrong"

Also, pretending to understand a topic you clearly do not is an aversion tactic to avoid admitting you are wrong. We are so afraid to be incorrect, we will go through a conversation pretending to understand things instead of asking for clarification. All because we are afraid to admit we do not know..

Some people are embarassed to not know a simple fact. For example, if you ask someone who grew up in the US who the first president was, most would reply "George Washington". However, sometimes one might reply "Abraham Lincoln", or some other famous name instead. This answer will commonly be met with laughter, contributing to the replier's embarassment. However, as soon as you correct the replier, their knowledge of the first US president stands equal to your own.

Why would the embarassment linger? You both now know the same thing. Should embarassment not resolve after this moment?
