Notes for installing egglib and bio++ for popgen stat calculations

Great reference here I will try and follow:
http://pmagwene.github.io/blog/2013/02/06/building-bio-plus-plus-and-egglib/

However, need to make sure it will find where I install these.
I am unable to write to /usr/local so installing in non-default location

Seems I only need bpp-core and bpp-seq, might as well grab bpp-popgen while I'm at it.

Previously compiled egglib to ~/include

remove this because I believe we need bpp installed before compiling egglib... but how to tell egglib where bpp is...

try in virtual environment location:

Error:

cmake version problem?
[yoccaala@dev-intel14 bpp-core-2.0.3]$ cmake --version
cmake version 3.11.1

yea, so changed source file: /mnt/home/yoccaala/miniconda3/envs/Python2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tmp/bpp/bpp-core-2.0.3/src/Bpp/Io/FileTools.cpp

bool test = file;

to

bool test;
test = static_cast<bool>(file);

where ever it shows up. Ooof, looks like I need to do this with all of them

actually, for bpp-seq/popgen I did not need to edit the files

`
make
make install

cd ../bpp-seq-2.0.3
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/miniconda3/envs/Python2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
make
make install

cd ../bpp-popgen-2.0.3
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/miniconda3/envs/Python2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
make
make install
`

Now hopefully egglib will cooperate.. delete previous installation

egglib-py-2.1.7.tar.gz from sourceforge

`

ugh, bpp in wrong place, move here:

grrrr

backup and get cpp libraries first

`
tar xvzf egglib-cpp-2.1.7.tar.gz

`
hmmm probably should have specified a location
remove and redo

Now time for egglib-py
`
mkdir tmp/egglib
tar xvzf egglib-py-2.1.7.tar.gz
cd egglib-py-2.1.7
source activate Python2
python setup.py build --prefix=/mnt/home/yoccaala/miniconda3/envs/Python2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
`
still didn't find bpp libraries. need to find it while compiling egglib-cpp

checking configure script for where it searched for bpp

{ $as_echo "$as_me:${as_lineno-$LINENO}: checking for main in -lbpp-core" >&5
$as_echo_n "checking for main in -lbpp-core... " >&6; }
if ${ac_cv_lib_bpp_core_main+:} false; then :
  $as_echo_n "(cached) " >&6
else
  ac_check_lib_save_LIBS=$LIBS
LIBS="-lbpp-core  $LIBS"
cat confdefs.h - <<_ACEOF >conftest.$ac_ext
/* end confdefs.h.  */

from egglib-cpp configure output:
checking for main in -lbpp-core... no
checking for main in -lbpp-seq... no
checking for main in -lbpp-popgen... no

this is a 6000 line file how the hell do we find this? Why isn't using the same prefix working?

what if I install ???

where is it looking for bpp?

got it!! for this step at least:
`
export LDFLAGS='-L/mnt/home/yoccaala/miniconda3/envs/Python2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/lib/'
./configure --prefix=/mnt/home/yoccaala/miniconda3/envs/Python2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
`

now messing up the LDFLAGS variable causes make to fail. Unsure of what it was set to before
hmmmm add to lib path?

lets symlink the include directory and try again

symlink worked but getting new error:
BppDiversity.cpp:183:76: error: conversion from ‘std::vector<unsigned int>’ to non-scalar type ‘std::vector<long unsigned int>’ requested
                 std::vector<size_t> temp = bpp::SequenceStatistics::MKtable(ingroup, outgroup, *p_code);
                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I don't really need this function so lets try and comment out

seems to have done it!

`
make
make install

cd ../egglib-py-2.1.7
source activate Python2
python setup.py build --prefix=/mnt/home/yoccaala/miniconda3/envs/Python2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
`

ugh, still cannot find bio++ where the hell was egglib-cpp built?
symlink include to tmp egglib-py directory?

Nope...

I think since there are warnings but no errors it is saying we dont have it. edit setup.py:

`
NOBPP = bool(len(stderr))
#Manual	edit by	Alan Yocca
#09-10-20
#bpp is	there but throwing warnings so this code says we don't have it
NOBPP =	bool(0)
`

checking Bio++...
   g++ -pthread -B /mnt/home/yoccaala/miniconda3/envs/Python2/compiler_compat -Wl,--sysroot=/ -I/mnt/home/yoccaala/miniconda3/envs/Python2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/include -c -o testdep.x testdep.cpp
 ... found
 
 hopefully it really was..

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'delete_BppDiversity'

do we need this class? BppDiversity
could remove....

at this point I think its best to remove everything and retry anyway, so might as well go for commenting things out

commented this out also

  File "/mnt/home/yoccaala/miniconda3/envs/Python2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/egglib/egglib_binding.py", line 2728, in <module>

seems to be importing fine now?

nope... running selectionStats.py not finding bpp_diversity module....

ugh. lets restart?
no why is it not finding this module?
I think its trying to read cpp libraries but they don't have bpp integrated, must have been a problem during compilation of egglib-cpp

so just going to retry the egglib-cpp
why is it only looking in current directory for the Bpp directory?
symlinking this directory allowed for an error free compilation.. but maybe that wasn't the right fix

check configure where its looking for them but thats a mess, oh whale go for it, at 11 move on to something different

`
export CPPFLAGS="-I../../../include"
./configure --prefix=/mnt/home/yoccaala/miniconda3/envs/Python2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
make
`

then get the same vector type error, try deleting again
edit lines in setup.py also...
